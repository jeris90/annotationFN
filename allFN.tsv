the impact of covid-19 is risible	209	NoArgument	Israel has gone the more extreme route, and has now given itself authority to surveil any citizen without a court warrant.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	210	NoArgument	Poland on the other hand is requiring those diagnosed with COVID-19 ordered to self-isolate to send authorities a selfie using an app.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	211	NoArgument	Which, if Poles don’t respond back in 20 minutes with a smiling face, they risk a visit from police, Dailymail reported.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	220	NoArgument	As Activist Post previously wrote while discussing the increase of a police surveillance state, these measures being put into place now will likely remain long after the pandemic has stopped and the virus has run its course.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	222	Argument_against	The covid-19 is now classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and it may very well be a legitimate health concern for all of us around the world.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	251	Argument_against	- As Flu-Like Illnesses Explode Across America, One Homeless covid-19 Carrier Could Cause Havoc.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	252	Argument_against	While much of the mainstream media continues to sound like a broken record playing within an echo chamber with the Washington Post joining Foreign Policy , Wikipedia , Fact Check , PolitiFact and numerous others recently putting out stories echoing the same globalist talking point, that this covid-19 outbreak was not caused by a bioweapon or linked to any labs in Wuhan, China and such reports are 'conspiracy theories' or 'disinformation' , stories like this new one over at the Daily Mail directly from China and the South China University of Technology beg to differ.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	253	Argument_against	As the Daily Mail story reports , following a lengthy study into this covid-19 outbreak, Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology concluded that the killer covid-19 probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan' while pointing out that research on bats and respiratory diseases carried by the animals at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and the Wuhan Institute of Virology happened only 300 yards away from the seafood market originally blamed for the outbreak.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	254	NoArgument	And with a leading medical journal now reporting this outbreak is highly contagious and much more deadly than originally estimated according to this linked study by the Los Alamos National Laboratory which we've also embedded at the bottom of this story, each of us needs to decide what information we're going to believe and how we're going to prepare for this outbreak, what the mainstream media is reporting or what we're learning from the independent media.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	255	NoArgument	And now we learn from Senator Tom Cotton that China is refusing to hand over any evidence or information the US had requested about the Wuhan biolab in question.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	256	Argument_against	With Mike Adams reporting in this new story over at Natural News that a pandemic could achieve all of the globalists satanic objectives, including depopulation and the kind of authoritarian government being implemented in China being rolled out in America and across the planet, we learn in this important new Zero Hedge story that even those who've been infected and recover from covid-19 are not safe and in fact, those who become re-infected often die sudden deaths from total heart failure.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	257	Argument_against	Doctors working on the front lines of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak have told the Taiwan Times that it's possible to become reinfected by the virus, leading to death from sudden heart failure in some cases.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	258	Argument_against	It's highly possible to get infected by the covid-19 a second time.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	259	NoArgument	A few people recovered from the first time by their own immune system, but the meds they use are damaging their heart tissue, and when they get it the second time, the antibody doesn't help but makes it worse, and they die a sudden death from heart failure, reads a message forwarded to Taiwan News from a relative of one of the doctors living in the United Kingdom.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	260	NoArgument	Also, the source said that false negative tests for the virus are fairly common.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	261	NoArgument	It can fool the test kit there were cases that they found, the CT scan shows both lungs are fully infected but the test came back negative four times.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	262	NoArgument	The fifth test came back positive.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	263	Argument_against	So when we read stories about people coming back from China who are testing negative, that doesn't really mean that they really are negative for covid-19 and as has been reported again and again, those who aren't even showing symptoms can still spread the virus to others.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	264	NoArgument	And with a locust plague like 'something out of the Book of Exodus' devouring entire farms in Kenya within as little as 30 seconds, it's easy to understand why some warn it feels like we're moving towards the 'end times' as Michael Snyder reports in this Charisma News story.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	265	NoArgument	Following Susan Duclos' heart attacks and hospitalization, All News Pipeline will need some financial help in the months ahead.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	266	NoArgument	So if you like stories like this, please consider donating to ANP to help keep us in this 'Info-war' for America at a time of systematic censorship and widespread corruption.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	267	Argument_against	As has been reported previously, covid-19 presents to many with very few symptoms, with a sore throat the only symptom one carrier of the virus was showing according to the CDC who has warned the disease can be spread by those who show no symptoms at all, so the map we see above from the Flu Near You website gives us another very good reason to avoid the big cities across America if possible where among the large homeless population should it arrive, it could spread like wildfire.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	268	Argument_against	With many of the large clusters of those reporting either flu-like symptoms or any symptoms at all this very moment near the large East-coast megalopolis that stretches from Washington DC north towards New York and Boston, concerning is this Los Angeles Times story which reports covid-19 is spreading as readily as the 1918 Spanish flu, an outbreak which ended up killing between 20 and 50 million after infecting 1/3 of the world's population .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	269	Argument_against	Even this story over at The Atlantic had reported that Medieval diseases are now running rampant among the homeless in the big cities of California, diseases such as typhus and tuberculosis, so imagine just one carrier of covid-19 getting loose in one of the massive homeless encampment's in San Francisco or Los Angeles or even here on the East coast in Baltimore, Atlanta, New York city or even Washington DC.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	270	Argument_for	And as we see in the map below from the CDC's flu tracker website , so called 'influenza-like illnesses' are in the high range all across America right now with only a few states in moderate to low yet with covid-19 presenting with a full range of different symptoms that are very similar to the flu, it's understandable that hospitals in 5 different US cities are testing people for covid-19 if they show up with flu-like symptoms.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	271	NoArgument	Those cities are Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	272	Argument_against	Yet with many 'false negatives' coming back in tests of people who had covid-19 as we previously mentioned had been reported in this Zero Hedge story , all bets are off about how far it has already spread in America with some not showing symptoms for up to 24 days .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	273	Argument_for	As we had mentioned within our opening segment, Mike Adams points out in this must-read story as also heard in the final video at the bottom of this story just how 'fortuitous' this covid-19 outbreak could be for the globalists, allowing them to 'kill many birds with one stone' .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	274	NoArgument	While the globalists depopulation agenda has long been called 'conspiracy theory' , how many other leftists think just like Cambridge Professor Patricia MacCormack who just wrote a book about how 'only human extinction can save the planet' ?
the impact of covid-19 is risible	275	NoArgument	Actually writing in her book that the only answer to 'climate change' would be for the human race to be wiped out, calls for MacCormack to be the first to volunteer for that honor have gone unanswered.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	276	NoArgument	Yet as Mike Adams points out in this story, such a sinister plan may be coming together perfectly for the globalists.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	277	Argument_for	If the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) pandemic began from an accidental release, it sure was a happy accident for the globalists.Everything the pandemic is achieving just happens to perfectly fit the top priorities of the globalist agenda.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	278	Argument_against	The covid-19 pandemic is currently on track to infect 60%-80% of the world population and kill up to 15% of those infected, according to an increasing number of doctors and scientists.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	279	Argument_against	Conservatively, this could kill up to half a billion people (500 million people), which would go a long way toward accomplishing the globalist goal of depopulation.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	280	NoArgument	The pandemic allows governments to declare medical martial law, with gunpoint-enforced quarantines, mandatory vaccinations and government kidnapping of children from parents who refuse to go along with the medical tyranny.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	281	Argument_for	The covid-19 is a dream come true for the CDC and the vaccine industry.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	282	NoArgument	Simultaneously, the pandemic also allows Big Tech to justify total censorship and de-platforming of anti-vaxxers, who will of course be immediately blamed for every infection and every death, as soon as a commercial vaccine is available .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	283	Argument_against	Make no mistake, this CoVid-19 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is almost the perfect weapon against humanity that keeps the globalists in power and even increases their tyranny on a global scale.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	284	NoArgument	It's almost as if dare we say the virus was intelligently designed with these goals in mind.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	285	Argument_against	Also mentioning within his story the possibility of covid-19 being used to both crash the US economy as well as used to defeat President Trump in November, would you put it past them to do such evil things?
the impact of covid-19 is risible	286	NoArgument	ANP EMERGENCY FUNDRAISER: With non-stop censorship and 'big tech' attacks upon independent media, donations from readers are absolutely critical in keeping All News Pipeline online.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	290	NoArgument	NY Times finally admits issues with China’s COVID-19 statistics.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	291	NoArgument	In a recent live blog, the New York Times finally acknowledged there are issues with the Chinese government’s reported statistics.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	292	NoArgument	The New York Times headlined the issue, “Models predicting expected spread of the virus in the U.S. paint a grim picture.”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	293	NoArgument	“As the death toll ticked past 3,000 on Tuesday, the nation was set to overtake that of China, where 3,305 people have reportedly succumbed to the virus, although the Chinese figures are coming under increasing scrutiny.”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	294	NoArgument	For example, last week, the New York Times published an article with the headline, “China hits a covid-19 milestone: No new local cases.”
the impact of covid-19 is risible	295	NoArgument	But that article and its headline did not address the West’s skepticism about the Chinese government’s reported statistics.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	296	Argument_against	The Wall Street Journal reported that the Chinese government admitted its statistics on covid-19 infections were inaccurate.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	297	NoArgument	The government said that it did not include about 1,500 cases where patients were asymptomatic-yet-infected with the virus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	298	Argument_against	It created further doubts about China’s reported cases, due to the Chinese government’s cover-up of the initial virus outbreak and ongoing propaganda efforts to blame the U.S. military for spreading the covid-19.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	299	NoArgument	According to WHO data, China reported a total of 82,447 cases with 3,310 deaths.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	300	NoArgument	Adding in the 1,500 previously-unreported cases, the total rises to 83,947.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	301	NoArgument	But it was not clear whether some of the 1,500 infected cases should be included in the death toll, which would affect reported fatality rates and give a more-complete picture of the virus’s effects on Chinese society.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	302	NoArgument	Western newspapers and the likes of the WHO were left guessing the accuracy of China’s reported cases.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	303	NoArgument	It took at least a week for the New York Times to acknowledge that there are accuracy and reporting issues with the Chinese government’s reported statistics on the covid-19’s spread in China.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	304	NoArgument	The New York Times should not have taken a week to dance around the reality that the Chinese government cannot be fully trusted and that its statistics should not be taken at face value, considering the Chinese government’s initial cover-up of the outbreak and its ongoing propaganda efforts that blame the U.S. military for the virus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	305	NoArgument	CNN avoids blaming China for misleading coronavirus data - Accuracy in Media.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	306	Argument_against	One by one, the mainstream media is acknowledging that there should be more skepticism about the Chinese government’s covid-19 infections data.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	307	NoArgument	But the media coverage remains sparse and few between, with a handful of articles from the likes of the New York Times and CNN expressing doubt without detracting their wall-to-wall covid-19 coverage.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	308	Argument_against	CNN headlined its skepticism, “As China goes back to work, many wonder if the country’s covid-19 recovery can be trusted” CNN wrote, “But as China appears to be turning a page on the virus, new questions are being raised about how much the numbers being reported can be trusted, and whether the worst of the outbreak has truly passed.”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	309	NoArgument	The cable news network pointed out how there were serious discrepancies in the Chinese government’s reporting.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	310	Argument_against	It cited a Chinese publication’s report, “There were thousands more funeral urns delivered to Wuhan than would be accounted for by the official covid-19 death toll.”
the impact of covid-19 is risible	311	NoArgument	CNN then tempered the funeral urns report and said the data discrepancies “may be because of something that many countries are struggling with, a shortage of tests.”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	312	NoArgument	CNN hedged on its criticism of Chinese government data and used available reports, such as Bloomberg’s report that U.S. intelligence believed the Chinese government fudged its covid-19 data.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	313	NoArgument	Instead, CNN relied on anecdotal accounts about a lack of testing, thus providing a weak criticism of the Chinese government.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	314	NoArgument	It is encouraging that CNN published an article that expressed skepticism about China’s covid-19 data, but these types of articles do not make the front pages or chyrons in cable news shows.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	315	NoArgument	While the American public is subjected to the media’s wall-to-wall covid-19 coverage, the media buried articles like these to demonstrate that it did due diligence in investigating China’s unverifiable covid-19 data.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	316	Argument_against	The bottom line is that the mainstream media, including CNN, should emphasize how China’s government continues to cover up the covid-19 outbreak without repercussions.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	317	NoArgument	Their cover-up has had cascading and devastating effects on the global economy, let alone leading to significant death tolls in Italy, Spain, Canada and the United States, to name a few.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	318	NoArgument	US Scientist Warned Apocalyptic Virus Could Escape Lab At Epicenter Of Coronavirus Outbreak 2 Years Ago.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	319	NoArgument	While I began my story Thursday on the covid-19 reporting that we weren't overly concerned about the outbreak happening half the planet away, as we reported in a major update to that story, a 2017 story over at Nature written about a top secret, BSL-4 level laboratory in Wuhan, China that would soon be opened to handle some of the world's deadliest pathogens has caused us to look at all of this in a completely different manner.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	320	NoArgument	As we'd reported within that update, 'some scientists outside of China worried about pathogens escaping' from that Wuhan, China pathogen lab and while we're not in the position at this moment to confirm that is what indeed happened, the spread of a virus that one disease expert compared to having the death rates of the Spanish flu while another SARS Virologist claimed, this time, I'm scared , has gotten a lot of ANP readers talking in our comment sections about how to prepare for the arrival of such an outbreak in America.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	321	Argument_against	With one US scientist warning 2 years ago about the very real possibility of an apocalyptic virus escaping from that lab in Wuhan as Metro reports in this new story , and Live Science reporting that only one lab could ' safely handle ' the covid-19 and that lab was in Wuhan , one might argue that lab was NOT able to safely handle this mysterious virus , or as others have argued, may have even intentionally released it.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	322	NoArgument	And with this Daily Mail story warning a woman in Chicago who recently flew in from Wuhan, China is the latest person in America to have been diagnosed with covid-19, with at least 63 more people in the US being monitored including at least 4 people in New York, some are reminded of the mutations and spread of the man-made virus in the movie 12 Monkeys , where airplanes were the 'vector' for the viruses release and spread as it wiped out most of the global population.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	323	NoArgument	With Wuhan, China now looking like a ghost town as seen in the image at the top of this story as was reported in this new story at The Sun and the very real possibility this virus was something that 'escaped' from that BSL-4 Lab in Wuhan, China, and Chinese officials surely never giving the world the truth about it, we'll be taking a look within this story at some ANP readers suggestions about how to go about preparing for this 'beasts' arrival in America knowing what we now know about it.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	324	Argument_against	We'll also be looking at a theory of Celeste Solum at Shepherds Heart who warns the rollout of covid-19 may have been timed to coincide with the rollout of 'global government' .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	325	NoArgument	Following Susan Duclos' recent heart attacks and hospitalization, All News Pipeline will need some financial help in the days ahead.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	326	NoArgument	So if you like stories like this, please consider donating to ANP to help keep us in this 'Info-war' for America at a time of systematic censorship and widespread corruption .).
the impact of covid-19 is risible	327	NoArgument	As Celeste points out in this new story over at Shepherd's Heart , the globalists have long been pushing for a 'one world government' and a 'global health emergency' might just offer them the 'crisis' that they've been looking for and pushing for.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	328	Argument_against	And as Susan Duclos had mentioned to me, if this deadly virus was actually something that was created or intentionally released from a lab in China, it could be considered 'an act of war' should it have been 'weaponized' as Mike Adams reported of the covid-19 in this January 22nd story at Natural News.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	329	Argument_against	So with a virtually unknown, deadly pathogen released upon the world, as we'd reported within our January 23rd ANP story , one of the very most critically important things that we can do should covid-19 become widespread here in America is prepare to self-quarantine ourselves and our families away from the rest of the masses.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	330	NoArgument	And to be able to do that effectively means stocking up on anything that we might need including food, water and supplies so that we don't have to go into grocery stores and other public locations as we'll explore much more in the next section of this story below.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	331	NoArgument	With China just deploying their military to help fight the virus spread helping to show just how dangerous they believe this outbreak is and experts now warning thousands more could be infected by the virus and not yet showing symptoms , (including those who may have already left Wuhan and traveled via air travel to America and other locations), of great concern is the fact that this disease can be spread via the air , making it spread much more quickly and more likely than non-airborne viruses.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	332	Argument_against	As Mike Adams had also reported in this new story over at Natural News , covid-19 is spreading among people who show non-respiratory symptoms.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	333	Argument_against	This means detection of the carriers of the covid-19 is going to be extremely difficult, given that nearly all health officials around the world are looking for respiratory symptoms such as coughing, sneezing and breathing difficulties .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	334	NoArgument	So how many people who've come down with the illness but aren't showing symptoms are now walking around freely in America or elsewhere, spreading it to others who also may not show any symptoms until they've infected many others?
the impact of covid-19 is risible	335	NoArgument	And as the Daily Mail reports in this new story , China's President Xi Jinping has just warned the world that the outbreak is accelerating there with at least 56 million Chinese people now under lockdown.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	336	NoArgument	So what does China know about this outbreak that we don't know?
the impact of covid-19 is risible	337	NoArgument	My friends in China speak of thousands infected and over 100 people dead.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	338	NoArgument	Chinese greatly underreporting what is really going on.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	339	NoArgument	My friends tell me that infected people are being rejected by Wuhan hospitals.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	341	NoArgument	Welcome to the 2020 version of the Spanish influenza.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	342	NoArgument	Not meaning to scare folks but when China quarantines one of their largest second tier cities, (11 million people) it believes the situation is quite serious.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	343	NoArgument	I am hearing some of the same things from people I know in Taiwan.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	344	NoArgument	And with other ANP readers such as 'Master of Reality' bringing up the movie 12 Monkeys while 'Icy Peacemaker' brings up the infamous Captain Trips virus from Stephen King's The Stand , we see that this Infowars story is warning of the very same thing.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	345	Argument_against	The respiratory virus known as covid-19 that's killed 17 in China is mutating in a way similar to the deadly virus at the center of the dystopian film 12 Monkeys .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	346	NoArgument	In the 1997 sci-fi thriller, a deadly pathogen known as kalavirus (or M5-10) wipes out 7 billion people in 2016, which mutates several times over the years, killing even more of the initial outbreaks survivors.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	347	Argument_against	Like the kalavirus, the Chinese-borned covid-19 has mutated several times already, with some experts calling it as deadly as the Spanish flu epidemic which killed 50 million people worldwide in 1918 .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	348	Argument_against	The covid-19, which originated in the Chinese province of Wuhan, has infected 471 people across several countries and killed 17, indicating a kill rate of about 3%.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	349	NoArgument	The kalavirus, on the other hand, had a kill rate of 95%.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	350	NoArgument	Chinese National Health Commission Deputy Director Li Bin said the virus is likely a community-based transmission, meaning it could or has mutated given its spread to medical workers and individuals in different countries.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	351	NoArgument	Experts have said possibly thousands of people are already infected.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	352	NoArgument	The idea of a super-virus that wipes out mankind has gained traction in pop culture, movies, and entertainment over the last 20 years, such as with the films World War Z, I Am Legend, Book of Eli, 28 Weeks Later, and The Crazies.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	353	NoArgument	Notably, a cultural zombie marketing craze has exploded in tandem over the last decade due to shows like The Walking Dead, where zombie hordes rise up due to an outbreak of a deadly virus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	354	NoArgument	So as we'll explore in the final section of our story below, whether this new and mysterious virus in China is something apocalyptic out of 12 Monkeys or simply a globalist ploy to usher in global government based upon a 'health emergency' , we serve our families and loved ones best by preparing for whatever may be ahead.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	355	Argument_against	When taking a look at the image above from The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory and Institute of Virology, we get a small look at what people working within that facility have to wear to return home to their families healthy every day so when prepping for something like covid-19, we'll have to take extraordinary steps if it ever comes to America and starts spreading like the flu.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	356	Argument_against	As Business Day reports in this new story , if nothing else, covid-19 is a deadly warning to be extremely vigilant.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	357	NoArgument	So while we'll continue to stress preparing ourselves to self-quarantine for a period of time should covid-19 spread here in America like it already is in China, and to do so means stocking up on any kinds of food and supplies that we'll need so we can even avoid the grocery stores, we'll also have to look at getting prepared for those times when we absolutely have to go out in case 'the worst case scenario' arrives here.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	358	NoArgument	As several ANP readers mentioned within our comment sections, while the people in China are going out and purchasing masks in an attempt to help ward off the virus, there may be very real difficulties in a regular mask stopping something so small that you'd need an electron microscope just to see it from getting in so as both 'Michael Day' and 'Icy Peacemaker' had mentioned, spraying the masks with an anti-viral, anti-bacterial solution could be the difference between life and death.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	359	NoArgument	Michael had also mentioned that we need look no further than the Bible where Frankincense and Myrrh were gifts from the Wise Men to our Savior Jesus, oils used for many years and around the world to ward off illness and disease and oils that could be sprayed upon masks to help make sure viruses and bacteria cannot get through.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	360	NoArgument	And Susan Duclos and I will both swear by the antibacterial, antiviral properties of garlic , with garlic used historically to ward off the 'black death plague' that killed tens of millions .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	361	NoArgument	Thanks to Susan for compiling the following links to products that while we hope we'd never have to use, they might work wonders in a TEOTWAWKi scenario.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	364	NoArgument	And this book by 'Cat Ellis' titled Prepping for a Pandemic: Life-Saving Supplies, Skills and Plans for Surviving an Outbreak (Preppers) offers some excellent pandemic prepping suggestions.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	365	Argument_against	And while we're happy to report that according to this story over at LewRockwell , the average human being's chances of developing symptoms or dying from covid-19 are well below 1%, if this is a weaponized virus or a virus that was intentionally released by China and/or the globalists to create havoc and help them achieve their 'depopulation agenda' and 'global government' , then all bets are off about the odds of developing the disease.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	366	NoArgument	However, our odds of survival increase greatly when we simply prepare for whatever may be ahead as our videographers argue in both the 1st and 2nd videos below.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	367	Argument_against	In the 3rd and final video below, Mike Adams warns that a covid-19 'perfect storm' now exists in America thanks largely to Democrats policies of 'open borders' allowing nearly unlimited illegal immigration here and particularly, what's happening in big, Democrat-run cities all across the country where homelessness is exploding, many are living and defecating in the streets and things are spiraling out of control before covid-19 fully arrives here.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	368	NoArgument	Just imagine those same cities should we have an outbreak here like they're having in China!

the impact of covid-19 is risible	409	Argument_for	It is easy to give top care to 70 covid-19 patients (possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars in care to each person).
the impact of covid-19 is risible	410	Argument_against	However, it is not so easy to give such care to 70,000 covid-19 patients, or 700,000 which is probably closer to the REAL number of cases in China.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	411	NoArgument	Quality of care goes down, you start getting numerous deaths.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	414	Argument_against	Another cruiser released hundreds in Cambodia and from there, throughout the world via commercial airlines : yet an american old woman eventually tested positive to COVID, so another chain of contamination is taking place simultaneously to the Diamond quarantine which is not good for damage control.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	453	NoArgument	Which is why now CDC is given 100% control of their baby, in the wild they want first-hand feed-back, and they need to counter the counters to the virus as it moves along.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	454	NoArgument	They demand control over USA testing, and also every doctor that questions a patient about the virus, that doctor must first report to CDC, where they lead the doctor by the nose on tight criteria of who gets a test kit, if approved its shipped by FEDEX arriving day's later.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	544	NoArgument	At an emergency meeting in China on Feb. 21, Chinese leader Xi Jinping talked at length about the urgency facing the country as the novel coronavirus, known as covid-19, continues to spread.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	545	Argument_against	That was no surprise considering the fact that, according to official figures from China, there have been nearly 80,000 cases and the death toll is fast approaching 3,000, though outside experts suspect China is downplaying the figures and they are significantly higher than that.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	548	NoArgument	China has a Level 4 microbiology lab called the National Biosafety Laboratory—and, of all places, it located at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, ground zero for the viral outbreak.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	590	NoArgument	Last month, Donald Trump retweeted a doctored photo of himself playing the fiddle that was labeled “My next piece is called: nothing can stop what’s coming.” It was clearly an homage to the Emperor Nero who so infamously made music while Rome burned.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	591	NoArgument	To it, the president added this comment: “Who knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	592	Argument_against	Whether Trump is fiddling these days or not, one thing is certain: in a Nero-like fashion, he continues to be irresponsibly unresponsive to the crisis caused by Covid-19.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	593	NoArgument	One reason may be that, however inadvertently, the arrival of the pandemic has helped green-light plans and projects he’s held dear to his heart and that had, before the crisis, repeatedly encountered opposition.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	594	NoArgument	Here are six examples of how the coronavirus, like a malign magic wand, has helped cast a disempowering spell over that opposition and so furthered Trump’s long-term goals.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	595	NoArgument	1) The Southern Border: Since the day he entered the Oval Office, Trump has been focused on closing and sealing the border between Mexico and the United States.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	596	NoArgument	Incrementally, his administration had moved from incarcerating upwards of 50,000 migrants and asylum seekers attempting to enter the United States at that border to — in the wake of the covid-19 — closing it completely to nonessential traffic and anyone trying to claim asylum.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	597	NoArgument	Migrants who enter the U.S. illegally now will be returned to their native countries illegally.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	598	NoArgument	“Border security is health security,” the president claims .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	599	NoArgument	In his persistent determination to close the border and punish migrants and asylum seekers alike, Trump has long allied with the Department of Justice to clear a path for his policies.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	600	NoArgument	Attorney General William Barr’s department has, for instance, fought battle after battle to counter legal challenges to the prolonged detention of both migrants and asylum seekers, to prevent aid to sanctuary cities that offer protection to such migrants, to overrule Board of Immigration Appeals decisions, and to withhold bail from detained asylum seekers.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	601	NoArgument	Until the covid-19 pandemic hit, however, the courts had increasingly been blocking some of these policies or putting them on hold.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	602	NoArgument	Now, although judges, lawyers, and legal organizations have urged that immigration courts be closed until the pandemic lifts, they have generally remained open even, in some cases, after people in them had tested positive for the virus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	603	NoArgument	The danger, not to say inhumanity, of all this, should be undeniable, but it does reflect President Trump’s ongoing immigration urges.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	604	NoArgument	In addition, the administration has doubled down on an existing policy of denying medical services to detained immigrants.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	605	NoArgument	This past winter, for instance, doctors were prevented from delivering flu vaccines to those in immigration detention camps.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	606	Argument_against	Now, with more than 37,000 men, women, and children confined, the dangers of the virus spreading among them are obvious and inevitable.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	607	NoArgument	As a former acting director of ICE puts it , the crowded conditions of detention, “which are designed to have people remain in close contact,” are “the opposite of the social distancing that is needed to save lives.”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	608	NoArgument	2) The Census: The census has long been a source of contention for this president.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	609	NoArgument	He waged a campaign to exclude non-citizens from participating in it only to be stalled in his efforts by the justices of the Supreme Court who decided that they needed more information to make a final decision on the subject.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	610	NoArgument	The issue at hand is that census results are used to determine how many congressional seats (based on population) are to be given to each state.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	611	NoArgument	If immigrants, both legal and undocumented, are not counted — and estimates are that roughly 6.5 million people fall into those two categories — then fewer politicians and less federal funding will be distributed to areas with more sizeable populations of them.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	612	NoArgument	Originally, Trump responded to the Supreme Court’s decision by advocating that the census simply be put off.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	613	NoArgument	Eventually, the administration backed down and the census was not delayed.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	614	NoArgument	Now, however, the sands have shifted.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	615	NoArgument	Covid-19 has turned the largely door-to-door gathering of census information into so many online , phone, and mail responses.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	616	NoArgument	The consequences of an inaccurate census could indeed prove dire.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	617	NoArgument	As National Public Radio’s Hansi Lo Wang reported , citing data collected by the Urban Institute, the 2020 census could result in “the worst undercount of black and Latino and Latina people in the U.S. since 1990.” According to one local San Francisco paper , “If the Census count is artificially low, the ramifications in this and every city will be real.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	618	NoArgument	It is estimated that each undercounted person costs his or her municipality ,000 in federal resources.” Funding for public schools would reportedly be severely hit by such cuts in federal funding.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	619	NoArgument	3) Global Conflicts: In his three years in office, Trump has escalated tensions with numerous powers, China and Iran in particular.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	620	NoArgument	In the period leading up to the global spread of the virus, China had already taken on special enemy status.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	621	NoArgument	In January, the president imposed yet more tariffs on that country’s products while sanctions on 70 billion worth of Chinese imports were left in place even though his administration claimed to have successfully concluded what he called “phase one” of a future trade deal .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	622	Argument_against	Now, he’s labelled Covid-19 the “ Chinese virus ,” using that label to escalate tensions with China (and provoke a xenophobic backlash here at home).
the impact of covid-19 is risible	623	NoArgument	He recently mentioned a friendly hour-long conversation with that country’s president, Xi Jinping, about combatting the virus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	624	NoArgument	But while reportedly preparing temporary relief when it comes to tariffs generally, Chinese imports are expected to be exempted from the proposed pause in payments.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	625	Argument_against	So, too, the virus has been used to escalate tensions with Iran .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	626	NoArgument	Trump had already increased the drumbeat to war with that country by ordering the drone assassination of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, leading to retaliatory missile strikes on U.S. military bases in that country.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	627	NoArgument	Congress then passed a law aimed at preventing the president from further attacks on Iran without its approval.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	628	NoArgument	Nevertheless, in the early days of the devastating spread of the pandemic in Iran, the Trump administration launched several attacks on pro-Iranian militias in Iraq and continued to uphold its economic sanctions on Iran itself.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	629	NoArgument	And there are reports of more to come from his administration.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	630	NoArgument	4) Isolationism: Since the onset of his presidency, Trump has sought to separate the U.S. from allies and diminish its participation in international treaties and agreements of all sorts.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	705	NoArgument	Most governors used boilerplate language citing public health experts in their announcements.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	706	NoArgument	But some evidence shows that Republican governors were responding to leadership from President Donald Trump, who largely downplayed the severity of the pandemic for weeks, which discouraged governors from taking actions that contradicted the leader of their party.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	713	NoArgument	Other Republican governors acted earlier.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	714	NoArgument	One factor in those cases is Trump’s approval ratings: Republicans in states where the president is unpopular moved more quickly .

the impact of covid-19 is risible	739	NoArgument	We were in a Cold War that easily could have turned hot and taken all our lives.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	740	NoArgument	Of course, it’s easy to forget that we had 25,000 nuclear warheads aimed at each other across the East-West divide.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	741	NoArgument	So if America could cultivate dissension and sow division between the two biggest Communist dictatorships, and so weaken the “Second World,” so much the better.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	742	NoArgument	That was how Henry Kissinger sold President Nixon the idea of cozying up to the Chinese Communists.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	743	NoArgument	After 25 years of nonrecognition and isolation, an American president wasn’t simply going to reestablish perfunctory ties with Beijing, but instead, he spent a whole week in China as a part of normalizing relations with the dictatorship.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	744	NoArgument	At a time when the main threat to us was the continued global spread of Communism and nuclear war with the dictatorship in Moscow, such a move had a quality of intuitive seduction.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	745	NoArgument	Yet Kissinger’s idea of weakening the “Socialist International” by driving a wedge between Beijing and Moscow broke one of the cardinal rules of good strategy: it is never wise to empower one enemy simply for the sake of weakening another, more proximate one.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	746	NoArgument	Nixon’s fatal acquiescence to the plan to lure China away from Moscow led to Beijing’s playing America—and the West—like a cheap fiddle in the decades that followed.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	748	NoArgument	With America on its side, the Chinese Communist Party could skillfully engineer post-Kuomintang China’s reception back into global political life and international trade.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	749	NoArgument	Whether the administration was run by Republicans or Democrats, China would move inexorably closer to the position it craved: the maintenance of an ironclad dictatorship within its borders, while also having the freedom to trade with the whole world and influence international affairs as “just another country.” And we let it happen.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	750	NoArgument	From Jimmy Carter’s decision to reinstate their “Most Favored Nation” trading status in 1979, to China’s accession under George W.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	761	NoArgument	Yes, it seems that China is the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	762	NoArgument	Yes, it has abused and persecuted those who have spoken out about what really happened in Wuhan in December and January, and then launched an international propaganda campaign to downplay their government’s culpability.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	770	NoArgument	How FDA red tape prevented widespread coronavirus testing | The Alliance for Natural Health.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	771	Argument_against	As COVID-19 cases increase exponentially, there is a major bottleneck in deploying widescale testing for the virus that has hampered our ability to deal effectively with this pandemic.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	772	NoArgument	One significant reason for this failing was the lack of flexibility and ineptitude at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
the impact of covid-19 is risible	773	NoArgument	This highlights how desperately the FDA needs to be overhauled so it can efficiently protect the health and safety of Americans.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	774	NoArgument	The federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic was lacking from the beginning.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	775	NoArgument	The CDC insisted on developing their own test rather than use technical guidelines already published by the World Health Organization (WHO).
the impact of covid-19 is risible	776	NoArgument	The CDC’s test turned out to be faulty, which further delayed widespread testing.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	777	NoArgument	Limited testing capacity also prevented community-based surveillance, a screening practice that can help track the virus and identify hidden hot spots.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	778	NoArgument	Had this occurred, local quarantines may have helped to confine the disease.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	779	NoArgument	Interviews with state and local public health officials and scientists paint a picture of a “bewildering bureaucratic process” that prevented private labs from springing into action.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	780	NoArgument	Click Play To Watch the US Testing Rollout.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	781	NoArgument	More significant is the role the FDA played in delaying, and in some cases blocking, access to tests.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	782	NoArgument	Laboratory developed tests are generally not subject to FDA pre-approval .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	783	NoArgument	But when Health and Human Resources Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency , new rules kicked in that actually made it harder for labs and hospitals to develop their own COVID-19 diagnostic tests.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	784	NoArgument	Labs would need to receive an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)—in essence, pre-approval—from the FDA before they could deploy COVID-19 tests.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	785	NoArgument	According to former FDA officials , in previous outbreaks EUAs could be obtained in a matter of days; but during this outbreak, the application process reportedly became so complicated that it took weeks to receive the authorization.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	786	NoArgument	Initially, labs were not allowed to begin testing until they got approval from the FDA, even if the lab had confirmed internally that the test worked..
the impact of covid-19 is risible	787	NoArgument	The FDA later relaxed this requirement, allowing certain accredited labs to begin testing as they awaited approval for an EUA—but not before weeks had passed when hospitals and labs were forced to sit on their hands while they possessed useable COVID-19 tests.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	788	NoArgument	Some companies had developed at-home tests developed in accordance with accredited labs.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	789	NoArgument	Individuals would collect their own specimens and send them off to a lab to perform the diagnostics.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	790	NoArgument	The benefits of at-home testing are obvious: healthcare workers can focus on treating sick patients rather than collecting specimens, and patients can get tested safely without going to a clinic or doctor’s office and potentially infecting others or getting infected themselves.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	791	NoArgument	Just days after these tests became available and samples started coming in, the FDA announced that it had not approved any at-home COVID-19 tests.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	792	NoArgument	This prompted companies marketing the tests to pause their distribution and, worse yet, to destroy the samples they had already collected to comply with FDA bureaucracy.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	793	NoArgument	Part of the concern seems to be in collecting viable samples.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	794	NoArgument	The most commonly used test (a polymerase chain reaction test ) uses nasopharyngeal samples to isolate viral RNA, which requires sticking a long, Q-tip-like wand as far into the nose as it will go to collect secretions from the uppermost part of the throat.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	795	NoArgument	This process is reportedly quite uncomfortable .
the impact of covid-19 is risible	796	NoArgument	The tests developed by these other companies use different methods: one uses oral swabs of the throat, one uses inner-cheek swabs, and one uses saliva.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	797	NoArgument	The companies stated they were working with accredited labs that had received the FDA emergency authorization to develop tests, and that the labs met federal standards for demonstrating the accuracy of their coronavirus tests.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	798	NoArgument	The FDA insists , however, that its emergency guidelines for coronavirus testing do not apply to at-home tests, including self-collection of samples to be sent to a clinical laboratory.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	799	NoArgument	The FDA is also holding up test kits from overseas: at least one South Korean firm, which is churning out 400,000 test kits a week, has been shipping the kits around the world, including to individual states in the US and private labs.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	800	NoArgument	The one remaining obstacle is FDA approval: according to one Korean CEO, “The biggest hurdle when it comes to the United States is getting the FDA approval.”.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	897	NoArgument	“It is a self-contained virus with specific properties.”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	898	Argument_against	The main difference between the flu and the corona virus is that the latter has been far more deadly so far because while around 0.1% of people who contract the flu ultimately die from it, the covid-19 mortality rate is currently around 3.4% based on the current number of reported cases and deaths.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	899	Argument_against	However, the death rate of the novel covid-19 is still developing as more cases are confirmed.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	900	NoArgument	Many health professionals believe that as the number of cases increases, the rate will decrease over time.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	912	NoArgument	In the 2018/19 season, approximately one in every 1,000 flu patients died.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	913	NoArgument	However, the breakdown of the numbers by age group shows a somewhat more complex situation.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	914	NoArgument	Around 10,000 children died in children.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	915	NoArgument	In adults between 50 and 64 years old, about six out of 10,000 people who had the flu died.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	916	NoArgument	For people aged 65 and over, however, the rate rose to around 83 out of 10,000.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	917	NoArgument	While the mortality rate from flu is relatively low, it varies depending on the strains of virus that circulate each year.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	918	NoArgument	The flu virus also mutates very quickly, so people can be infected with different strains, which is why vaccination is not 100% effective and new vaccines are developed every year.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	919	Argument_against	About 15% of covid-19 patients over the age of 80 have died from it.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	920	Argument_against	The covid-19 is more deadly than the flu in all age groups, but especially in the elderly.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	921	NoArgument	This is the result of studies by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, published in mid-February.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	922	NoArgument	It also affects people who already have health problems more severely.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	923	Argument_against	According to the Chinese authorities, about four out of every 1,000 died between 10 and 40 years of age who contracted the covid-19.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	925	NoArgument	Here’s how the corona virus compares to a number of other serious virus outbreaks:.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	926	NoArgument	One reason why the corona virus is more deadly than the flu: it is still new.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	927	Argument_against	Ghebreyesus said one reason the covid-19 death rate is so much higher than the flu is that it is the first time that humans have had it.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	928	Argument_against	“While many people around the world have built immunity to seasonal flu strains, COVID-19 is a new virus that nobody is immune to,” he said in the meeting.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	929	NoArgument	“This means that more people are susceptible to infections and some will become seriously ill.”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	930	Argument_against	We have vaccines and therapeutic agents to prevent and treat seasonal flu, but no cures for the covid-19 are known.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	931	NoArgument	However, scientists are trying to develop treatments and vaccines to stop their spread: biotech company Gilead is testing a drug called Remdesivir, and Moderna has submitted a potential vaccine for initial testing.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	932	NoArgument	Prevention of the spread of the flu and coronavirus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	933	NoArgument	The flu and coronavirus spread in the same way: through virus particles that mediate between people in tiny droplets or saliva and mucus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	934	NoArgument	If a sick person sneezes, coughs or eats at a distance of 1 to 1.5 meters from a healthy person, these particles can land on the healthy person.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	935	NoArgument	If the particles get into this other person’s eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	936	NoArgument	The flu is extremely efficient at spreading to other people before this newly infected person starts to show any symptoms.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	937	NoArgument	However, the corona virus does not work exactly the same way.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	938	Argument_for	“According to the data available so far, COVID-19 is not transmitted as efficiently as influenza,” said Ghebreyesus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	939	NoArgument	That said, containment was still possible, he added.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	940	NoArgument	“We don’t talk at all about curbing seasonal flu – it’s just not possible.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	941	NoArgument	But it is possible for COVID-19, “said Ghebreyesus.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	942	Argument_for	“We don’t track seasonal flu, but countries should do it for COVID-19 because it prevents infection and saves lives.”.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	943	NoArgument	God’s handiwork is remarkable.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	944	NoArgument	His magnificent signature is written throughout creation.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	945	NoArgument	A striking place to observe this is in the plant world.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	946	NoArgument	While you might look at a plant and simply see a stem, leaves, branches, and seeds, zoom in further to see thousands of molecules, compounds, and signaling pathways firing at once.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	947	NoArgument	Molecular changes in plants constantly reflect changing conditions of development and adaptation.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	948	NoArgument	Researchers and clinicians are currently looking at a compound called hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for COVID-19.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	949	NoArgument	What is this, and what does it have to do with plants?
the impact of covid-19 is risible	950	NoArgument	Hydroxychloroquine is a synthetic derivative of a compound called quinine.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	951	NoArgument	Quinine is a naturally occurring compound in plants.

the impact of covid-19 is risible	961	NoArgument	2) Current evidence reveals hydroxychloroquine and another quinine derivative, chloroquine, might have a role in effectively treating COVID-19.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	962	NoArgument	The CDC has updated information on its website about its possible role in treatment.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	963	NoArgument	3) One of the big mysteries scientists are working to uncover is how exactly hydroxychloroquine works in the body to treat diseases like COVID-19 and malaria.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	964	NoArgument	Researchers have uncovered that hydroxychloroquine works against diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus by modulating the immune response.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	965	NoArgument	4) Uncovering more information on its mechanism of action will lead to greater treatment options and possibilities in the future.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	966	NoArgument	It is important to note that when treatment is attempted outside the realm of professional practice and without a qualified physician, self-treatment has proven lethal.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	967	NoArgument	A couple in Arizona ingested chloroquine phosphate believing it would provide protection.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	968	NoArgument	Instead, the husband died and the wife is in critical condition.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	969	NoArgument	5 Tonic water also does not work as self-treatment because the concentration of quinine in it is diminutive and in the wrong form.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	970	NoArgument	6) Additionally, some people react to quinine, so the key is to work with a physician.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	971	NoArgument	One patient, in working with and following the guidance of his doctor and support team, has seemed to recover from the virus, crediting the drug for saving his life.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	972	NoArgument	7) God’s design is the best design, and we have still much to learn from his marvelous handiwork.
the impact of covid-19 is risible	973	NoArgument	As of today there are no major clinical trials or large scale research studies confirming the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.

public health demands vaccinations	1008	Argument_for	Researchers Claim To Develop Universal Flu Vaccine… – 1AFSYM.
public health demands vaccinations	1009	Argument_for	CBS Local — As Americans deal with a devastating flu season that has already claimed hundreds of lives, researchers at Georgia State University claim they’ve developed a way to produce a “universal flu vaccine” that could protect patients for several years with just one shot.
public health demands vaccinations	1010	Argument_for	Dr. Lei Deng and Dr. Baozhong Wang say that a new approach of using double-layered protein nanoparticles to target the influenza virus produced a longer lasting immunity to the flu in mice.
public health demands vaccinations	1011	Argument_for	“We’re trying to develop a new vaccine approach that eliminates the need for vaccination every year,” Dr. Wang, an associate professor at Georgia State, said in a press release .
public health demands vaccinations	1012	Argument_for	“You wouldn’t need to change the vaccine type every year because it’s universal and can protect against any influenza virus.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1013	Argument_against	The researchers say the yearly flu shot targets protein “heads” that attack the body and make people feel sick.
public health demands vaccinations	1014	Argument_against	The problem with those shots is that scientists make the annual injection so hyper-focused on killing one particular strain of the flu that the vaccines become fairly useless once these protein heads mutate.
public health demands vaccinations	1015	NoArgument	“This vaccine is composed of very conserved domains.
public health demands vaccinations	1016	Argument_for	That’s the reason why the induced immunity can offer universal protection,” Dr. Deng explains.
public health demands vaccinations	1017	NoArgument	Georgia State is now looking to move their tests of the nanoparticle vaccine on to ferrets, who have a similar respiratory system to humans.
public health demands vaccinations	1018	Argument_for	The CDC says the current flu vaccine in the U.S. has a success rate of around 40 percent.
public health demands vaccinations	1019	Argument_against	A similar injection in Australia reportedly prevented the flu in just 10 percent of patients during their flu season.

public health demands vaccinations	1021	NoArgument	"London (AFP) – Trolling, impersonating, demonising: these are just some of the behaviours encouraged in a new online game launching Tuesday in which young players become ""fake news tycoons"" — to counter growing misinformation."
public health demands vaccinations	1022	NoArgument	Researchers at Cambridge University have teamed up with a Dutch media collective to develop an English version of the game aimed at inoculating people against the spread of so-called fake news.
public health demands vaccinations	1023	NoArgument	The exercise encourages participants, who are tasked with building audiences for their imaginary fake news sites, to stoke fear, anger and mistrust by simulating the manipulation of online content.
public health demands vaccinations	1024	NoArgument	In the game they choose polarising falsehoods to publish, cultivate an army of Twitter bots, fabricate evidence, and propagate dubious articles and conspiracy theories.
public health demands vaccinations	1025	NoArgument	"""If you know what it is like to walk in the shoes of someone who is actively trying to deceive you, it should increase your ability to spot and resist the techniques of deceit,"" said Sander Van Der Linden, director of the university’s Social Decision-Making Lab."
public health demands vaccinations	1026	NoArgument	"The psychological theory behind the effort is called ""inoculation""."
public health demands vaccinations	1027	NoArgument	"Researchers at Cambridge last year found that briefly exposing people to tactics used by fake news producers can act as a ""psychological vaccine"" against bogus anti-science campaigns."
public health demands vaccinations	1028	NoArgument	"A pilot study conducted with teenagers in a Dutch high school used an early paper-and-pen trial of the online game, and showed the perceived ""reliability"" of fake news to be diminished in teens that played compared to a control group."
public health demands vaccinations	1029	Argument_for	"""A biological vaccine administers a small dose of the disease to build immunity,"" said Van Der Linden."
public health demands vaccinations	1030	NoArgument	"""Similarly, inoculation theory suggests that exposure to a weak or demystified version of an argument makes it easier to refute when confronted with more persuasive claims."""
public health demands vaccinations	1031	NoArgument	The game, based in part on existing studies of online disinformation, takes its cues from actual conspiracy theories about organisations such as the United Nations, and about issues such as vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1032	NoArgument	It is set to be translated for countries such as Ukraine, where disinformation campaigns are particularly rife.

public health demands vaccinations	1035	NoArgument	A patient recovers from the flu at the Palomar Medical Center in Escondido, Calif. Gregory Bull/AP.
public health demands vaccinations	1036	NoArgument	he entire continental United States is experiencing widespread flu right now, the first time in the 13 years of the current tracking system that that has happened, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
public health demands vaccinations	1037	NoArgument	Officials said that this flu season is shaping up to be one of the worst in recent years.
public health demands vaccinations	1038	NoArgument	The rate of flu hospitalizations — the number of people hospitalized with flu per 100,000 — nearly doubled last week compared with the previous week.
public health demands vaccinations	1039	NoArgument	Last week it was 22.7 per 100,000 people; the week before that rate was 13.7.
public health demands vaccinations	1040	NoArgument	At the peak of the 2014-15 season, one of the two most severe seasons in the last 15 years or so, 29.9 people out of every 100,000 were hospitalized for flu.
public health demands vaccinations	1041	NoArgument	Related Story: ‘The problem child of seasonal flu’: Beware this winter’s virus.
public health demands vaccinations	1042	NoArgument	The latest data — for the week ending Jan. 6 — suggest the season may be peaking right now, the CDC’s director, Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, told reporters Friday.
public health demands vaccinations	1043	NoArgument	But she warned that many more people will be infected before the season is over.
public health demands vaccinations	1044	NoArgument	There’s a difference between an active flu season — when a large number of people get sick — and a severe season, when the numbers of people hospitalized for flu or who die from the infection are unusually high.
public health demands vaccinations	1045	NoArgument	It can be hard to tell in real time where a flu season will fall on the severity scale, because sometimes reports of influenza hospitalization and deaths — especially deaths among children — lag.
public health demands vaccinations	1046	NoArgument	That said, this year is starting to look like a severe season, and maybe more severe than last year, which was also bad, said Dr. Dan Jernigan, head of CDC’s influenza division.
public health demands vaccinations	1047	NoArgument	“There’s lots of flu in lots of places,” he said.
public health demands vaccinations	1048	NoArgument	So far, Jernigan said, this year’s season doesn’t appear to be quite as bad as 2014-15.
public health demands vaccinations	1049	NoArgument	The influenza A virus H3N2 has caused the lion’s share of the illness in most parts of the country this year.
public health demands vaccinations	1050	NoArgument	But recently there’s been an uptick in activity by another influenza A virus, H1N1, Jernigan said, warning that even if the season appears to have peaked, flu viruses will circulate for weeks to come and people should continue to take precautions against getting infected.
public health demands vaccinations	1051	NoArgument	Jernigan said that people over the age of 65 are being hospitalized for flu this season more than any other population.
public health demands vaccinations	1052	NoArgument	Even people age 50 to 64 are being hospitalized in high numbers.
public health demands vaccinations	1053	NoArgument	Popular Now!
public health demands vaccinations	1054	NoArgument	‘The problem child of seasonal flu’: Beware this winter’s virus.
public health demands vaccinations	1055	NoArgument	Flu often hits the ends of the age spectrum more than the middle, and that’s the case this year as well.
public health demands vaccinations	1056	NoArgument	The CDC reported seven more children have died from flu, bringing the season total to 20 so far.
public health demands vaccinations	1057	NoArgument	While tragic, that number is low in comparison with other years — 110 last year, 92 in 2015-2016.
public health demands vaccinations	1058	NoArgument	But if other seasons are a gauge, that grim tally may continue to rise in coming weeks.
public health demands vaccinations	1059	Argument_for	Officials feared that the flu vaccine may not work particularly well this season, but it appears to be faring slightly better than expected.
public health demands vaccinations	1060	Argument_for	Preliminary testing by the CDC suggests the vaccine is probably more protective than it was in Australia during its 2017 winter.
public health demands vaccinations	1061	Argument_against	The Australian interim estimate suggested the H3N2 component of the vaccine — and H3N2 was the main virus there during their most recent winter — was only about 10 percent effective.
public health demands vaccinations	1062	Argument_for	That means if 100 people got the flu shot and all were exposed to H3N2 viruses, 10 would have been protected.
public health demands vaccinations	1063	Argument_for	Jernigan said it looks more like the H3N2 portion of the vaccine is performing here like it did last year, when it was 34 percent effective at preventing infection.
public health demands vaccinations	1064	NoArgument	Unfortunately, that’s about on par for the flu shot’s H3N2 component, which is the weak link of flu vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1065	NoArgument	The CDC should have interim data on the question of the vaccine’s effectiveness in the second half of February.

public health demands vaccinations	1094	NoArgument	Public safety: The new disguise for evil in today’s society – 1AFSYM.
public health demands vaccinations	1095	NoArgument	Oftentimes when government officials insist that a certain freedom needs to be eliminated or a new law enacted in order to advance the cause of “public safety,” it’s merely a smokescreen for some other covert agenda.
public health demands vaccinations	1096	Argument_against	And in many cases, this covert agenda actually advances evil in society, such as in the case of vaccines, which are often touted as being the single greatest advancement in “public health” that the world has ever seen.
public health demands vaccinations	1097	Argument_for	The official story is that vaccines are the safest and most effective way to prevent communicable diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1098	Argument_for	The public is told that everyone must get them or else the “herd” won’t be protected.
public health demands vaccinations	1099	Argument_for	And those who refuse vaccines, well they’re putting not only themselves and their children at risk of illness, complications and even death, but the rest of the community as well.
public health demands vaccinations	1100	NoArgument	It’s a persuasive technique to those who’ve bought the lie hook, line, and sinker.
public health demands vaccinations	1101	Argument_against	But the reality is that vaccines are loaded with chemicals that destroy immunity, damage the cellular system, and in some cases even result in sterilization.
public health demands vaccinations	1102	Argument_against	In fact, the technology for “weaponizing” vaccines has now become so advanced that childhood (and adult) jabs can even be used to target specific populations.
public health demands vaccinations	1103	NoArgument	Who might the deep state want to eliminate most?
public health demands vaccinations	1104	NoArgument	According to Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, black people and other minorities are often the primary targets , with everyone else also getting regular doses of its poisons all along the way.
public health demands vaccinations	1105	NoArgument	In other words, it’s basically a covert agenda of evil hidden behind the guise of “public safety.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1106	Argument_against	“The chemical that they found in the vaccines is called Beta BCG,” warns Adams and “Beta BCG causes the female body to have an immune system response that builds antibodies that destroy her own fetus if she gets pregnant.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1107	Argument_against	“Do you realize that through this chemical that they secretly insert into the vaccines , they can cause a black woman’s body to turn against itself and to murder its own baby in absolute violation of natural law and biblical principles and medical morality and everything else, and they were putting this sterilization chemical into these vaccines without the informed consent of the women who were being sterilized.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1108	NoArgument	“This is evil medicine.
public health demands vaccinations	1109	NoArgument	This is evil science.
public health demands vaccinations	1110	Argument_against	This is genocide in the name of vaccines for public safety, right?
public health demands vaccinations	1111	NoArgument	That’s what they tell you.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1112	NoArgument	GMOs that ‘feed the world’ are killing people in the name of ‘public welfare,’ too.
public health demands vaccinations	1113	NoArgument	It’s not just vaccines that are a problem in this regard.
public health demands vaccinations	1114	NoArgument	Genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), which the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries claim are necessary to help “feed the world” and “prevent starvation” have also been weaponized to harm people’s bodies and make their immune systems weaker.
public health demands vaccinations	1115	NoArgument	Worse, genetic engineering can even be used to target specific genetic codes of certain ethnic groups while bypassing others, which Adams says is being used against black people as well.
public health demands vaccinations	1116	NoArgument	This evil technology is known as RNA interference , and it involves programming the genetic codes of modified plant crops to target certain genetic elements that are unique to one type of person over another.
public health demands vaccinations	1117	NoArgument	The end result is that the consumption of said modified crops by one ethnic group results in, say, sterilization, while everyone else who consumes the same modified crops sees no negative effects.
public health demands vaccinations	1118	NoArgument	The official story is that RNA interference, or GMO 2.0, is preferable to earlier GMO technologies because it eliminates the need for harmful pesticides and herbicides like Roundup (glyphosate).
public health demands vaccinations	1119	NoArgument	But what those pushing this technology aren’t telling the public is that it can be used for all sorts of evil purposes, including the targeting of black lives for elimination using highly-advanced poisoning vectors that are capable of differentiating between targets.
public health demands vaccinations	1120	Argument_against	Economic and political forces are driving the flu vaccine hysteria – not sound medical science – 1AFSYM.
public health demands vaccinations	1121	NoArgument	The flu season has been unusually severe, prompting even more calls by Big Pharma, the conventional medical cohort, and legacy media outlets for everyone to get a flu shot.
public health demands vaccinations	1122	NoArgument	Regular Natural News readers are well aware of the questions that have been raised by founding editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, and others about the safety and efficacy of vaccines in general.
public health demands vaccinations	1123	NoArgument	Newcomers can check the article archives for more information and draw their own conclusions.
public health demands vaccinations	1124	NoArgument	As per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 60 children have tragically died from the nationwide flu outbreak this season so far, ABC News reported .
public health demands vaccinations	1125	NoArgument	Most people, adults and children, are apparently being infected with the H3N2 strain.
public health demands vaccinations	1126	Argument_against	According to the GreenMedinfo website, the push for the flu vaccine is primarily economic and political rather than based on solid medical evidence.
public health demands vaccinations	1127	Argument_against	It is a heavily guarded secret within the medical establishment (especially within the corridors of the CDC) that the Cochrane Database Review (CDR), considered by many within the evidence-based medical model to be the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic value of common medical interventions, does not lend unequivocal scientific support to the belief and/or outright propaganda that flu vaccines are ‘safe and effective.’, to the contrary, these authoritative reviews reveal there is a conspicuous absence of conclusive evidence as to the effectiveness of influenza vaccines…”.
public health demands vaccinations	1128	Argument_against	Referencing another study, GreenMedinfo maintained that “Vaccines, therefore, may actually decrease resistance to viral infection via their immunosuppressive actions.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1129	Argument_against	Along these lines, Natural News explained earlier this month than many of the people who have been suffering with influenza received the vaccination before becoming dangerously ill.
public health demands vaccinations	1130	Argument_against	Last November, Natural News suggested four reasons why individuals and/or families may decide against getting a flu shot: The vaccine is not proven to work or to be safe, it contains toxic adjuvants, and can bring on adverse side effects.
public health demands vaccinations	1131	Argument_against	Getting the shot might sometimes weaken a person’s immune system for years, thus potentially making it substantially more susceptible to other strains of the virus.
public health demands vaccinations	1132	NoArgument	Moreover, anyone having an open mind about the risk-reward approach to vaccines, or merely suggesting further study about side effects or complications, or even implying that childhood vaccines should be administered incrementally rather than all at once, is subject to immediate “anti-Vaxxer” scorn from the Big Pharma-loving mainstream (or fake-stream) media.
public health demands vaccinations	1133	NoArgument	The latter rakes in bug bucks for airing prescription-drug commercials across its networks.
public health demands vaccinations	1134	Argument_against	“If the immune system is continually challenged with the vaccines, an environmental toxicants, nutritional deficiencies and/or incompatibilities, chronic stress, influenza is far more likely to take hold,” GreenMedinfo added.
public health demands vaccinations	1135	NoArgument	Whether to get a flu shot is, of course, a personal decision that can be based on a variety of factors.
public health demands vaccinations	1136	NoArgument	As an aside, however, have you noticed that many of the pontificating pundits who insist that vaccines and man-made climate change constitute settled science are often the same people who claim that gender is fluid and non-binary?
public health demands vaccinations	1137	NoArgument	Why Claims Of Unvaccinated Flu Deaths Are Highly Deceptive – 1AFSYM.
public health demands vaccinations	1138	NoArgument	A statement was made in January by the CDC chief: “ 85% of children who died from the flu this season were unvaccinated .”.
public health demands vaccinations	1139	Argument_for	Upon superficial glance, this claim might appear quite frightening to those who have not investigated the scientific literature on vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1140	NoArgument	The CDC has a propensity to omit important information, and the above claim implies that the flu deaths are attributed to a lack of vaccination.
public health demands vaccinations	1141	Argument_for	It’s important to understand why the deaths are NOT because they avoided the flu vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1142	NoArgument	The first point to keep in mind is that “unvaccinated” does not imply vaccine free history, it only means the individual did NOT receive this year’s seasonal influenza vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1143	NoArgument	[1] Further, one must also ask: where is the evidence (data) that proves the vaccination status of these individuals?
public health demands vaccinations	1144	NoArgument	We do not know the influenza vaccination history of the “unvaccinated” and the “vaccinated” individuals.
public health demands vaccinations	1145	NoArgument	It is likely that this is the first time many in the ‘vaccinated’ group have received the flu shot, and the ‘unvaccinated’ group could have possibly received the flu shot in prior seasons (possibly many years).
public health demands vaccinations	1146	Argument_against	Studies have demonstrated that seasonal influenza vaccine induces original antigenic sin — which means it selectively trains your body to produce an antibody response that will likely be worthless for the subsequent year’s influenza strain.
public health demands vaccinations	1147	NoArgument	This is because your immune system “remembers” how it previously responded to a pathogen, and this memory can be quite detrimental if its response is incorrect toward different strains (poor training is worse than no training).
public health demands vaccinations	1148	Argument_against	Thus, people who receive the seasonal flu shot are at higher risk for contracting more virulent, pandemic strains of the influenza that could potentially be fatal.
public health demands vaccinations	1149	Argument_against	Flu Shot Suppresses Your Immune System.
public health demands vaccinations	1150	NoArgument	Conversely, natural immunity (contracting the influenza naturally and subsequently convalescing) enables your immune system to have “heterosubtypic immunity,” — that is, the ability to produce antibodies to various flu strains.
public health demands vaccinations	1151	NoArgument	Moreover, immunity is a multifaceted process that includes antibodies as one component of the overall response; natural exposure to pathogens engages all layers of the immune system.
public health demands vaccinations	1152	Argument_against	Thus, the putative unvaccinated individuals who died quite possibly received prior year(s) flu shots that incorrectly trained their immune system.
public health demands vaccinations	1153	Argument_against	The flu vaccine is highly immunosuppressive – studies demonstrate that vaccinees have an increased susceptibility to infection.
public health demands vaccinations	1154	Argument_against	[3] If you have received the flu shot last year, or multifarious times prior, your immune system is likely weaker this year.
public health demands vaccinations	1155	NoArgument	No control for confounding variables in the data.
public health demands vaccinations	1156	NoArgument	We do not have any information on the health statuses of the vaccinated and unvaccinated deaths.
public health demands vaccinations	1157	Argument_against	Is there healthy user bias interfering: have many in the unvaccinated group been injured by prior vaccines, therefore immuno-compromised, and more vulnerable to death?
public health demands vaccinations	1158	NoArgument	What are the diets, vitamin D3 status, and further, other health seeking behaviors of each person?
public health demands vaccinations	1159	NoArgument	Therefore, this statistical scare tactic (85% unvaccinated) is absolutely rendered useless when fastidiously examined.
public health demands vaccinations	1160	Argument_against	In light of what the scientific literature imparts to us regarding the effects of vaccines on the immune system, it can be almost unequivocally guaranteed that the reason these individuals died from the flu was NOT because they avoided this year’s flu shot.
public health demands vaccinations	1161	NoArgument	Of course, this assumes the CDC is being honest about the vaccination statuses of the flu victims, which may be a precarious assumption given prior history.
public health demands vaccinations	1162	Argument_against	With that being said – in either case – the claims that the influenza vaccine is beneficial are uncorroborated by scientific data.
public health demands vaccinations	1163	NoArgument	Safety is another integral concern as well, which deserves its own article.

public health demands vaccinations	1172	NoArgument	Since only two out of every ten refugees are vaccinated, they are passing around measles which is spreading into surrounding communities with no sign of stopping.
public health demands vaccinations	1173	NoArgument	The problem is becoming so prolific it could soon reach an “epidemic” status.
public health demands vaccinations	1174	NoArgument	According to MPR News, the outbreak has dramatically increased with the start of the month-long Muslim holiday of Ramadan:.
public health demands vaccinations	1175	NoArgument	“Health care and religious leaders are working in tandem to control Minnesota’s measles outbreak, which has stricken the state’s majority-Muslim Somali community.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1176	NoArgument	“With another three weeks of Ramadan and its numerous gatherings and prayers yet to come, officials face the challenge of getting through the holy month without the highly contagious disease spreading further.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1177	Argument_for	With all of the free healthcare and access to doctors and clinics that refugees are given on arrival, they have no excuse but to get vaccinated and slow the spread of this disgusting ourbreak.
public health demands vaccinations	1178	NoArgument	Even their imams are urging them to get the shot to stop it, but it’s up to each parent to take themselves and their children in to do it.
public health demands vaccinations	1179	Argument_for	“One of the imams, and I’m paraphrasing, he said, ‘If you don’t immunize, it’s like killing the Muslim children.’ I think that’s such strong messaging,” Ashkar said, according to MPR.
public health demands vaccinations	1180	NoArgument	By last Friday, there were already 73 known cases of the outbreak, which leaves one to wonder how many more there are considering that these uneducated people may not know what their symptoms are or how to deal with it.
public health demands vaccinations	1181	NoArgument	It’s too late before they figure it out after being in contact with so many other Muslims before symptoms show.

public health demands vaccinations	1191	NoArgument	Vaccine Fraud Exposed by 2 Merck Virologists; Company Faked Mumps Vaccine Results.
public health demands vaccinations	1192	Argument_against	Breaking news: According to two Merck scientists who filed a False Claims Act complaint in 2010 — a complaint which has just now been unsealed — vaccine manufacturer Merck knowingly falsified its mumps vaccine test data, spiked blood samples with animal antibodies, sold a vaccine that actually promoted mumps and measles outbreaks, and ripped off governments and consumers who bought the vaccine thinking it was “95% effective.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1193	NoArgument	See that False Claims Act document at:.
public health demands vaccinations	1194	NoArgument	According to Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski, both former Merck virologists, the Merck company engaged in all the following behavior:.
public health demands vaccinations	1195	Argument_against	• Merck knowingly falsified its mumps vaccine test results to fabricate a “95% efficacy rate.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1196	NoArgument	• In order to do this, Merck spiked the blood test with animal antibodies in order to artificially inflate the appearance of immune system antibodies.
public health demands vaccinations	1197	NoArgument	As reported in CourthouseNews.com:.
public health demands vaccinations	1198	Argument_against	Merck also added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, though it knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that “did not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life … virus neutralization in vaccinated people,” according to the complaint.
public health demands vaccinations	1199	NoArgument	( http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/06/27/478… ).
public health demands vaccinations	1200	Argument_against	• Merck then used the falsified trial results to swindle the U.S. government out of “hundreds of millions of dollars for a vaccine that does not provide adequate immunization.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1201	Argument_against	• Merck’s vaccine fraud has actually contributed to the continuation of mumps across America, causing more children to become infected with mumps.
public health demands vaccinations	1202	NoArgument	(Gee, really?
public health demands vaccinations	1203	NoArgument	This is what NaturalNews has been reporting for years…
public health demands vaccinations	1204	Argument_against	Vaccines are actually formulated to keep the outbreaks going because it’s great for repeat business!).
public health demands vaccinations	1205	NoArgument	• Merck used its false claims of “95 percent effectiveness” to monopolize the vaccine market and eliminate possible competitors.
public health demands vaccinations	1206	NoArgument	• The Merck vaccine fraud has been going on since the late 1990’s, say the Merck virologists.
public health demands vaccinations	1207	Argument_against	• Testing of Merck’s vaccine was never done against “real-world” mumps viruses in the wild.
public health demands vaccinations	1208	NoArgument	Instead, test results were simply falsified to achieve the desired outcome.
public health demands vaccinations	1209	NoArgument	• This entire fraud took place “with the knowledge, authority and approval of Merck’s senior management.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1210	Argument_against	• Merck scientists “witnessed firsthand the improper testing and data falsification in which Merck engaged to artificially inflate the vaccine’s efficacy findings,” according to court documents (see below).
public health demands vaccinations	1211	NoArgument	US government chose to ignore the 2010 False Claims Act!
public health demands vaccinations	1212	NoArgument	Rather than taking action on this false claims act, the U.S. government simply ignored it, thereby protecting Merck’s market monopoly instead of properly serving justice.
public health demands vaccinations	1213	Argument_against	This demonstrates the conspiracy of fraud between the U.S. government, FDA regulators and the vaccine industry.

public health demands vaccinations	1215	NoArgument	Following the unsealing of this 2010 False Claims Act, Chatom Primary Care, based in Alabama, smelled something rotten.
public health demands vaccinations	1216	NoArgument	Three days ago, Chatom filed a lawsuit against Merck.
public health demands vaccinations	1217	NoArgument	That lawsuit record is available here:.
public health demands vaccinations	1218	NoArgument	It alleges, among other shocking things:.
public health demands vaccinations	1219	Argument_against	Merck engaged in a decade-long scheme to falsify and misrepresent the true efficacy of its vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1220	Argument_against	Merck fraudulently represented and continues to falsely represent in its labeling and elsewhere that its Mumps Vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95 percent of higher.
public health demands vaccinations	1221	Argument_against	In reality, Merck knows and has taken affirmative steps to conceal — by using improper testing techniques and falsifying test data — that its Mumps Vaccine is, and has been since at least 1999, far less than 95 percent effective.
public health demands vaccinations	1222	NoArgument	Merck designed a testing methodology that evaluated its vaccine against a less virulent strain of the mumps virus.
public health demands vaccinations	1223	NoArgument	After the results failed to yield Merck’s desired efficacy, Merck abandoned the methodology and concealed the study’s findings.
public health demands vaccinations	1224	Argument_against	Chatom Primary Care also alleges that the fraudulent Merck vaccine contributed to the 2006 mumps outbreak in the Midwest, and a 2009 outbreak elsewhere.
public health demands vaccinations	1225	NoArgument	It says, “there has remained a significant risk of a resurgence of mumps outbreaks…”.
public health demands vaccinations	1226	NoArgument	This investigation is only beginning.

public health demands vaccinations	1232	NoArgument	21st Century Wire says… Obama’s bizarrely named “Ethic Panel” is telling American parents that their children (as young as infants?) need to be used as guinea pigs to perfect the pharmaceutical industry’s latest billion dollar brainchild: the anthrax vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1233	NoArgument	Parents, wake up now – or never.
public health demands vaccinations	1234	NoArgument	An Obama “Ethics Panel” Approves Testing Anthrax Vaccine In Children, Including Infants.
public health demands vaccinations	1235	NoArgument	Gee, I guess Obama’s peace and love unicorn-laden Garden of Eden ain’t so much.
public health demands vaccinations	1236	NoArgument	I’m curious to see your thoughts on this.
public health demands vaccinations	1237	NoArgument	Which infants will be used for testing?
public health demands vaccinations	1238	NoArgument	Will testing primarily affect the poor who may need money so desperately they’ll volunteer their children?
public health demands vaccinations	1239	NoArgument	My issue is, I so don’t trust the government at this point, not only about their agenda, but about actually getting something like this right.
public health demands vaccinations	1240	NoArgument	Everything the Fed touches these days seems to go awry, so it makes me very, very, nervous.
public health demands vaccinations	1241	Argument_against	A presidential ethics panel has opened the door to testing an anthrax vaccine on children as young as infants, bringing an angry response from critics who say the children would be guinea pigs in a study that would never help them and might harm them.
public health demands vaccinations	1242	NoArgument	The report, however, released on Tuesday by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, said researchers would have to overcome numerous hurdles before launching an anthrax-vaccine trial in children.
public health demands vaccinations	1243	NoArgument	It now goes to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, who will decide whether to take the steps the commission recommended.
public health demands vaccinations	1244	NoArgument	The one anthrax vaccine approved in the United States, called BioThrax, is made by Emergent BioSolutions Inc of Rockville, Maryland.
public health demands vaccinations	1245	NoArgument	The company reported $215.9 million in sales of BioThrax, its only licensed product, in 2012.
public health demands vaccinations	1246	NoArgument	The ethics commission took up the issue after a biodefense panel recommended in 2011 that the anthrax vaccine be tested in children.
public health demands vaccinations	1247	NoArgument	That endorsement, by the National Biodefense Science Board, came with the caveat that such a study also get the go-ahead from a bioethics panel.
public health demands vaccinations	1248	NoArgument	“We have to get this precisely right,” panel Chair Amy Gutmann, president of the University of Pennsylvania, said at a news conference.
public health demands vaccinations	1249	NoArgument	“Many significant steps would have to be taken” before a pediatric anthrax vaccine trial could be considered, she said.
public health demands vaccinations	1250	NoArgument	But she added that it is important “to develop the knowledge needed to save children’s lives” in the event of an anthrax attack.

public health demands vaccinations	1255	NoArgument	Which prompts us to ask this question again:.
public health demands vaccinations	1256	NoArgument	Should the government force parents to vaccinate their kids?
public health demands vaccinations	1257	NoArgument	Rebecca Bredow, a self-proclaimed ‘vaccine choice’ mom from Detroit, has just been sentenced to seven days in jail for contempt, defying a court order that states she agreed with her ex-husband to vaccinate their 9-year-old son.
public health demands vaccinations	1258	NoArgument	The judge also ordered to have the child vaccinated within one week, while Bredow is serving her jail sentence.
public health demands vaccinations	1259	NoArgument	Attorneys for the anti-vaxxer mom, who refused to jab her son based on her personal and religious beliefs, have said they will be filing an appeal.
public health demands vaccinations	1260	NoArgument	“I would rather sit behind bars standing up for what I believe in, than giving in to something I strongly don’t believe in,” Bredow said in her statement to the court.
public health demands vaccinations	1261	NoArgument	As WXYX-TV Detroit reports, the son’s father must get the child vaccinated before his mother gets out of jail, or this story could take yet another controversial turn.

public health demands vaccinations	1270	Argument_for	For the past several years, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been actively promoting the shingles vaccine as the solution to what some experts say is a building shingles epidemic.
public health demands vaccinations	1271	Argument_against	But a new study published in the German medical journal Der Hautarzt , or “ The Dermatologist ” in English, has revealed that the childhood vaccine for chicken pox, a common viral disease related to shingles, may actually be directly responsible for triggering this epidemic.
public health demands vaccinations	1272	NoArgument	Also known clinically as varicella-zoster virus (VZV), chicken pox is a relatively mild form of herpes virus that typically manifests itself during the early childhood years.
public health demands vaccinations	1273	NoArgument	Nearly all children who develop the condition at a young age, in fact, never develop it again, and are also usually imparted with lifelong immunity to both VZV and its relative, herpes zoster, a more severe form of the disease commonly referred to as shingles.
public health demands vaccinations	1274	Argument_against	According to the new study; however, getting vaccinated with the chicken pox vaccine, which first became commercially available in the U.S. back in 1995, could damage this natural immune cycle.
public health demands vaccinations	1275	Argument_against	Based on the available data, getting vaccinated for chicken pox may end up blocking the mechanisms the body uses to develop its own natural immunity to both chicken pox and shingles, causing much worse infection later on down the road.
public health demands vaccinations	1276	Argument_against	A five-year-old girl, it turns out, was found recently to have developed severe symptoms of shingles not long after being vaccinated for chicken pox.
public health demands vaccinations	1277	Argument_against	Researchers from Helios Klinikum in Germany conducted a direct immunofluorescence assay on the child to look for evidence of the vaccine strain in the infection, and found that the vaccine strain had, indeed, caused the child to become infected with the much more severe shingles virus.
public health demands vaccinations	1278	NoArgument	“This case demonstrates that a negative VZV direct immunofluorescence assay does not exclude an infection with the vaccine strain,” wrote the authors in their study abstract, which you can view here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23358727.
public health demands vaccinations	1279	Argument_against	Chicken pox vaccine prevents body from developing its own natural immunity to shingles.
public health demands vaccinations	1280	NoArgument	Adults, and particularly those who have not yet had the chicken pox, are said to be most prone to developing shingles, which is why the CDC and others are urging individuals over age 50 to get a shingles vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1281	Argument_against	But what this bloated bureaucracy is failing to disclose publicly is the fact that the sudden uptick in shingles cases is directly associated with the advent of the chicken pox vaccine .
public health demands vaccinations	1282	NoArgument	People who were vaccinated for chicken pox as children beginning in the 1990s are now eclipsing into adulthood.
public health demands vaccinations	1283	NoArgument	Many of these children have never had the chicken pox, which means their bodies have never had the chance to develop natural immunity to both future infection with chicken pox and shingles.
public health demands vaccinations	1284	NoArgument	As a result, this chicken pox-vaccinated generation is not only seeing an increase in shingles infections rates, but is also shedding the virus onto others.
public health demands vaccinations	1285	Argument_against	Back in 2005, Dr. Gary S. Goldman, Ph.D., the formed Editor-in-Chief of the charity Medical Veritas , published a study in the International Journal of Toxicology showing that even if the chicken pox vaccine did eradicate chicken pox as claimed, it would induce a much more severe shingles epidemic that would gradually build in intensity for up to 50 years.
public health demands vaccinations	1286	NoArgument	It now appears as though Dr. Goldman’s findings were, indeed, correct.

public health demands vaccinations	1288	Argument_against	Big Pharma vaccines may be ruining millions of lives each year in Western nations.
public health demands vaccinations	1289	NoArgument	We’re still learning more about this recent event, but initial reports are starting to surface about William Thompson, Ph.D. , epidemiologist and lead author of a 2007 study on the safety of vaccines — specifically, early exposure to a mercury compound, aka “Thimerosal” , among young children who receive vaccines like the MMR options.
public health demands vaccinations	1290	NoArgument	Thompson has been working as a scientist at the CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases (NCIR).
public health demands vaccinations	1291	NoArgument	This immediately calls to mind linkage between these vaccines and the development of early childhood autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1292	NoArgument	It’s been reported that Thompson likely soft-pedaled the findings of the study ( go here for the CDC’s archived press briefing) and is the anonymous whistleblower admitting that he ‘cooked’ data to hide a connection between autism and the vaccine .
public health demands vaccinations	1293	NoArgument	Let’s be clear.
public health demands vaccinations	1294	NoArgument	The NCIR promotes vaccines — this is not good news for this center, the CDC, or the Big Pharma industry.
public health demands vaccinations	1295	NoArgument	So, one must appreciate the gravity of the current situation outlined in the report below.
public health demands vaccinations	1296	NoArgument	We also find it highly suspect and predictable, if confirmed (Note: CDC has yet to make an official statement), that Thompson’s removal took place at the current height of the Ebola outbreak media frenzy.
public health demands vaccinations	1297	NoArgument	It’s also been reported that CNN’s “iReport” removed a wildly popular story on this topic shortly after its publication on their website:.
public health demands vaccinations	1298	NoArgument	The iReport story allegedly collected thousands of views and shares:.
public health demands vaccinations	1299	NoArgument	“As of late last night, the article had 45,232 views, 178 comments,( mostly people literally begging CNN and other media to cover it,) and a staggering 17 thousand shares.” (source: The Truth Barrier ).
public health demands vaccinations	1300	NoArgument	We cannot confirm these statistics about the shutdown story without some type of digital footprint — but does it really matter?
public health demands vaccinations	1301	NoArgument	For now, this is all we have — removed for violation of ‘Community Guidelines and Terms of Use’ — see image below:.
public health demands vaccinations	1302	NoArgument	[UPDATE: CNN has now reposted the story on a new iReport page , and upgraded its status to “NOT VERIFIED BY CNN.”].

public health demands vaccinations	1305	NoArgument	By Jon Rappoport.
public health demands vaccinations	1306	NoArgument	William W. Thompson, PhD… the CDC whistleblower…was escorted off the premises of the CDC campus yesterday afternoon.
public health demands vaccinations	1307	NoArgument	This is what a source has just told me.
public health demands vaccinations	1308	NoArgument	Therefore, the CDC knows Thompson is the whistleblower.
public health demands vaccinations	1309	NoArgument	He’s in danger.
public health demands vaccinations	1310	NoArgument	I’ve also been told that the Autism Media Channel , which had posted the video revealing Thompson’s name and outing him, is gone.
public health demands vaccinations	1311	NoArgument	The site is suddenly gone.
public health demands vaccinations	1312	NoArgument	Threats of various kinds, at the very least, will now be applied to Thompson.
public health demands vaccinations	1313	NoArgument	Legal action, perhaps arrest, perhaps worse.
public health demands vaccinations	1314	NoArgument	When it comes to vaccines and protecting that empire, the games are very serious.
public health demands vaccinations	1315	NoArgument	Deadly serious.
public health demands vaccinations	1316	NoArgument	The gloves come off.
public health demands vaccinations	1317	NoArgument	People have to understand this, if Thompson disappears or shows up dead “as a suicide.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1318	NoArgument	Since Thompson isn’t, as of this moment, stepping forward himself to provide full disclosure on his past actions, and since his name is already out there… the best protection he has is other people.
public health demands vaccinations	1319	NoArgument	Other people making his name and his dangerous situation known.
public health demands vaccinations	1320	NoArgument	That has to happen now.
public health demands vaccinations	1321	NoArgument	Prior to this morning, Thompson had been standing in the shadows as an anonymous source, admitting that he cooked data to hide a connection between autism and the MMR vaccine .
public health demands vaccinations	1322	NoArgument	Now other things are known.
public health demands vaccinations	1323	NoArgument	In 2007, he published a study on the effects of mercury (thimerosal) on babies and very young children—and he concluded that there were both positive and negative effects, but the effects on both sides were very small.
public health demands vaccinations	1324	Argument_for	The study was used by the press and the government to trumpet the idea that everybody could rest easy; vaccines containing mercury weren’t harming anyone.
public health demands vaccinations	1325	NoArgument	Now, this, too, comes under scrutiny.
public health demands vaccinations	1326	NoArgument	If Thompson was lying about the MMR vaccine, did he also lie about mercury and its toxic effects?
public health demands vaccinations	1327	NoArgument	Did he intentionally underplay those effects?
public health demands vaccinations	1328	NoArgument	Did he cook the data in that study, too?

public health demands vaccinations	1333	Argument_against	The seasonal disease has mutated over the years, and professionals say it has been made stronger as medicine continues to process vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1334	NoArgument	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) this season’s flu is widespread in 49 states, Wisconsin and Minnesota are covered in high levels of the flu.
public health demands vaccinations	1335	Argument_against	“I believe that the low effective rate of the vaccine this year is due to the mutations that the virus made in the processing of the vaccine itself,” said Anna Treague, nurse for Public Health.
public health demands vaccinations	1336	NoArgument	“That is at LEAST part of the reason that influenza cases are so widespread this year.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1337	NoArgument	The flu or influenza is a seasonal contagious respiratory disease that is caused by influenza viruses.
public health demands vaccinations	1338	NoArgument	The CDC says the dominant strain this year is H3N2, which tends to be more severe and causes more severe symptoms than most other strains.
public health demands vaccinations	1339	NoArgument	Treague said that symptoms include fever, chills, headache, dry cough and aching of muscles and joints.
public health demands vaccinations	1340	NoArgument	They usually appear 1 to 3 days after being infected with most people recovering within a week.

public health demands vaccinations	1351	NoArgument	I’m not kidding.
public health demands vaccinations	1352	NoArgument	It is not a new thing that some parents wouldn’t want their children to be vaccinated.
public health demands vaccinations	1353	Argument_against	They say that it is just wrong to inject their kids with a VIRUS—no matter what state it may be because they perceive it as making their children SICK.
public health demands vaccinations	1354	Argument_for	Physicians say otherwise as they believe that getting vaccinated will make one’s immune system ‘aware’ of viruses so that when it comes into contact with the body, our white blood cell ‘soldiers’ would know how to defend them.
public health demands vaccinations	1355	NoArgument	And for years, the doctors have been quite successful in convincing many people of this premise.
public health demands vaccinations	1356	NoArgument	But now, a recent study puts to light a not-so-new problem with vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1357	Argument_against	And it is mainly because its adjuvant ‘Aluminum’ may be doing more harm than good.
public health demands vaccinations	1358	Argument_for	Chemicals that are commonly used in the production of vaccines, according to the CDC, are done so to improve the effectiveness of the vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1359	Argument_for	Adjuvants like aluminum (one of the most common) are a component of vaccines that potentates the immune response to an antigen.
public health demands vaccinations	1360	NoArgument	The adjuvant is basically used to invoke the desired immune response.
public health demands vaccinations	1361	NoArgument	Aluminum has been added to vaccines for approximately 90 years, and since then, a lot of controversy, especially in recent years, has emerged regarding their safety and effectiveness.
public health demands vaccinations	1362	Argument_against	This controversy comes as a result of a number of recent studies (some of which are presented in this article) outlining clear concerns over the use of aluminum in this manner, as well as the fact that over the past few years, billions of dollars have been paid to families with vaccine injured children.
public health demands vaccinations	1363	Argument_against	There are a number of reasons why more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children.
public health demands vaccinations	1364	NoArgument	This is quite concerning, given the fact that recommended immunization rates have more than doubled in the past few decades.
public health demands vaccinations	1365	NoArgument	In some developed countries, by the time a child is 4 to 6 years old, they will have received a total of 126 antigenic compounds, along with high amounts of aluminum adjuvants through routine vaccinations.

public health demands vaccinations	1372	Argument_against	U.S. government approves STERILIZATION VACCINES to reduce deer populations, proving yet again that depopulation vaccines exist - 12160 Social Network.
public health demands vaccinations	1373	NoArgument	Ethan Huff –The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reportedly approved for use an immunocontraceptive vaccine known as “Zonastat-D” that will soon be used to manage the population numbers of white-tailed deer.
public health demands vaccinations	1374	NoArgument	The sterilization shot is the second of its kind in the Zonastat family, with Zonastat-H having been earlier approved for use in the control of wild horses.
public health demands vaccinations	1375	Argument_for	The Humane Society of the United States claims that Zonastat-H is already a “well established and effective” vaccine for wild horses, and authorities believe the same will be true for Zonastat-D and white-tailed deer.
public health demands vaccinations	1376	NoArgument	The vaccine contains what’s known as porcine zona pellucida, or PZP, a substance that’s extracted from the ovaries of pigs and adapted specifically for use in white-tailed deer.
public health demands vaccinations	1377	NoArgument	In short, it triggers the production of antibodies that basically bind to the protein envelopes that surround female deer eggs, effectively barring fertilization from taking place.
public health demands vaccinations	1378	Argument_for	So instead of having to shoot and kill white-tailed deer in order to keep them from overpopulating, wildlife management personnel can instead shoot Zonastat-D vaccines at the animals in order to sterilize them.
public health demands vaccinations	1379	NoArgument	And this sterilization shot is being called a “vaccine,” even though the Oxford Dictionaries defines a vaccine as a substance that stimulates the production of antibodies in order to procure immunity against disease – not to inhibit reproduction for depopulation purposes.
public health demands vaccinations	1380	NoArgument	Field studies on Zonastat-D date back to 1993 when scientists from multiple universities first began testing it on deer in New York, South Carolina, and elsewhere.
public health demands vaccinations	1381	Argument_for	They basically shot the animals from afar with tiny needles that contained the vaccine, which they found had an 85 to 90 percent success rate.
public health demands vaccinations	1382	Argument_for	They further claim that the vaccine is safe for the animals and doesn’t pass through the food chain, suggesting that people can still eat these deer without issue.
public health demands vaccinations	1383	Argument_for	“Adding this vaccine to the management toolbox enables wildlife managers to reduce populations gradually, often without resorting to lethal methods,” writes Wayne Pacelle for The Humane Society of America.
public health demands vaccinations	1384	NoArgument	“Sport hunting or sharpshooting management options are often considered unsafe, impractical, and unpalatable in many urban and suburban communities.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1385	Argument_against	So it’s true: vaccine ARE being used for depopulation purposes.
public health demands vaccinations	1386	NoArgument	Reality Check: CDC Scientist Admits Data of Vaccines and Autism Was Trashed - 12160 Social Network.
public health demands vaccinations	1387	NoArgument	Just days ago over 100 protesters gathered outside of the Centers for Disease Control offices in Atlanta demanding transparency when it comes to vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1388	NoArgument	So are these people conspiracy theorists, or did they have good reason to be there?
public health demands vaccinations	1389	NoArgument	I promise, this is a Reality Check you won’t get anywhere else.
public health demands vaccinations	1390	NoArgument	It is an incredibly controversial subject, but these protesters outside the CDC here in Atlanta say that the information being provided to the public about vaccines isn’t honest.
public health demands vaccinations	1391	NoArgument	And all of it hinges on one man, a scientist you’ve probably never heard of.
public health demands vaccinations	1392	NoArgument	That scientist is named Dr. William Thompson.
public health demands vaccinations	1393	NoArgument	It was on August 27, 2014 that he made an admission that got very little media coverage.
public health demands vaccinations	1394	NoArgument	But it was a major statement.
public health demands vaccinations	1395	NoArgument	That statement read in part, “I regret that my co-authors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal ‘Pediatrics’.
public health demands vaccinations	1396	Argument_against	“The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1397	NoArgument	Decisions were made regarding the findings of the report as the data was collected and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1398	NoArgument	I will explain the significance of that statement in a minute.
public health demands vaccinations	1399	NoArgument	But let’s be clear: Thompson did not come forward on his own.
public health demands vaccinations	1400	NoArgument	He released his statement only after he was secretly recorded by Dr. Brian Hooker.
public health demands vaccinations	1401	NoArgument	Once that happened, he hired a whistleblower attorney and turned over documents to Congress.
public health demands vaccinations	1402	NoArgument	Thompson still works for the CDC, and a few weeks ago, I requested a sit-down interview with him.
public health demands vaccinations	1403	NoArgument	Thompson refused that request.
public health demands vaccinations	1404	NoArgument	Even though he wouldn’t sit down with me, Thompson has claimed that he has handed documents about this case to Congressman Bill Posey’s office.
public health demands vaccinations	1405	NoArgument	I spoke with the congressman’s office about that, and a spokesperson confirms that thousands of documents were handed over.
public health demands vaccinations	1406	NoArgument	Sources within that office say as many as 100,000 documents were turned over.
public health demands vaccinations	1407	NoArgument	Congressman Posey brought this information to the floor of Congress and what he read there was stunning—that authors of the study not only hid the actual findings, but also attempted to destroy evidence.
public health demands vaccinations	1408	NoArgument	“The remaining four coauthors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can.
public health demands vaccinations	1409	NoArgument	However because I thought it was illegal and would violate La Jolla and DOJ requests, I kept hard copies in my office and retained all associated computer files.
public health demands vaccinations	1410	NoArgument	I believe that we intentionally withheld controversial findings from the final draft of the pediatrics paper.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1411	Argument_against	So in case you missed it there, Thompson, a CDC scientist and an author of the study in the journal Pediatrics that insisted that there was no link between vaccines and autism, admits that he and the other authors of that study left out information that was deemed controversial—information that in some African American male children, who are given the MMR vaccine before the age of two, did have an increased risk of autism and signs of autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1412	NoArgument	And that not only did the CDC hide that information, but that the authors of the study threw that evidence into a trash can and destroyed it.
public health demands vaccinations	1413	NoArgument	There is so much hysteria over this subject.
public health demands vaccinations	1414	NoArgument	Why is it that a person has to be for all vaccines given in all quantities at all times to all people, or a person is anti-vaccination?
public health demands vaccinations	1415	Argument_for	Vaccines have probably saved more lives on this planet than any other single medical advancement.
public health demands vaccinations	1416	NoArgument	You might know that.
public health demands vaccinations	1417	Argument_against	But what you might not know is that all vaccines in all quantities for all people are not safe.
public health demands vaccinations	1418	Argument_against	Every year hundreds of children are injured by vaccines, and since 1986 the United States Government has paid out $3 billion to the vaccine injury compensation program.
public health demands vaccinations	1419	NoArgument	Raise even one question about why that is, and you’ll get pushback.
public health demands vaccinations	1420	Argument_against	DISGUSTING: Study finds that animal vaccines have no safeguards against contamination and contribute to serious pet diseases like cancer - 12160 Social Network.
public health demands vaccinations	1421	NoArgument	Most of us are incredibly attached to our pets.
public health demands vaccinations	1422	Argument_for	As such, we do everything we can to prevent them from getting ill, including getting them vaccinated at the intervals recommended on the schedules we receive from their veterinarians.
public health demands vaccinations	1423	Argument_against	What we might not realize, however, is that in getting them vaccinated we may be exposing them to very dangerous retroviruses, some of which have been linked to cancer and other fatal animal diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1424	Argument_against	A study recently published in the journal Biologicals, entitled “Endogenous retroviruses as potential hazards for vaccines,” warns that the way in which animal vaccines are manufactured leaves them vulnerable to contamination by retroviruses which are present in the master seed stock of the cells used in their production.
public health demands vaccinations	1425	NoArgument	The manufacture of both human and animal vaccines is dependent on the use of live human and animal cells as seed stock.
public health demands vaccinations	1426	NoArgument	Unfortunately, as noted by GreenMedInfo, many of these cells are contaminated with endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).
public health demands vaccinations	1427	Argument_against	When animal vaccines that have been created using contaminated cells are injected into our furry friends, these illnesses can be handed over along with the vaccine’s “normal” contents.
public health demands vaccinations	1428	Argument_against	The study, which was conducted by researchers from the department of cell biology at Kyoto University in Japan, found that the risks associated with such vaccines have largely been ignored, leaving our pets vulnerable to serious diseases, including feline leukemia, the primary cancer diagnosed in cats.
public health demands vaccinations	1429	NoArgument	Feline leukemia is of particular concern to cat lovers, as it affects between 2 and 3 percent of all cats in the United States, and up to 30 percent of cats who are already battling other illnesses.
public health demands vaccinations	1430	NoArgument	Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine notes:.
public health demands vaccinations	1431	NoArgument	Cats persistently infected with [Feline Leukemia Virus] FeLV serve as sources of infection for other cats.
public health demands vaccinations	1432	NoArgument	The virus is shed in saliva, nasal secretions, urine, feces, and milk of infected cats.
public health demands vaccinations	1433	NoArgument	Cat-to-cat transfer of the virus may occur from a bite wound, during mutual grooming, and (rarely) through the shared use of litter boxes and feeding dishes.
public health demands vaccinations	1434	NoArgument	Transmission can also take place from an infected mother cat to her kittens, either before they are born or while they are nursing.
public health demands vaccinations	1435	Argument_against	And now, the Kyoto University study has confirmed that another possible avenue of infection is through the very vaccines we give our cats.
public health demands vaccinations	1436	NoArgument	So, what exactly are retroviruses, and why are they so difficult to fight off?
public health demands vaccinations	1437	NoArgument	[Retroviruses] get their supervillain status because of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which reads the virus’s RNA and turns it into DNA, which then makes its way into the cell’s DNA and attaches itself.
public health demands vaccinations	1438	NoArgument	Once the retroviral DNA is in the cell’s DNA, the cell just starts copying the new DNA along with its own.
public health demands vaccinations	1439	NoArgument	After the retroviral DNA infects the cell it can lie dormant for a while before it activates itself.
public health demands vaccinations	1440	NoArgument	On top of that, these viruses are reproduced a ton, so it provides lots of opportunities for mutation.
public health demands vaccinations	1441	NoArgument	All of this makes it incredibly difficult for the immune system to fight them off.
public health demands vaccinations	1442	Argument_against	Purposely injecting these dangerous retroviruses into our pets just doesn’t make much sense, does it?
public health demands vaccinations	1443	Argument_against	So, if you really love your best friend, keep him healthy through his diet and exercise and skip the vaccinations.
public health demands vaccinations	1444	NoArgument	Alfie killed on purpose - 12160 Social Network.
public health demands vaccinations	1445	NoArgument	WHITE MALE=”BADLY VACCINE DAMAGED”=”INFERIOR”.
public health demands vaccinations	1446	NoArgument	Alfie was killed on purpose to cover this up.
public health demands vaccinations	1447	NoArgument	Alfie Evans is dead Last night, before he died, I posted something similar to the following and then got trolled out of it.
public health demands vaccinations	1448	NoArgument	Well, as it turns out this is true so I re-typed it.
public health demands vaccinations	1449	NoArgument	If you see anything to the contrary, it is British government trollage.
public health demands vaccinations	1450	NoArgument	Alfie Evans was born perfectly normal, and got his condition at a year old, after receiving six vaccines in one doctor visit.
public health demands vaccinations	1451	Argument_against	The vaccines triggered an auto immune disorder that caused his immune system to destroy his brain.
public health demands vaccinations	1452	NoArgument	They are saying he had defective genes which caused him to waste away but that is the unilateral universal excuse fronted for vaccine damage every single time.
public health demands vaccinations	1453	NoArgument	They always blame it on “defective genes”.
public health demands vaccinations	1454	NoArgument	UNDENIABLE FACT: The British government really does not pay out if the kid dies befo... and for Alfie, age 2 was coming up in 14 days.
public health demands vaccinations	1455	NoArgument	British trolls are desperately trying to assert there is no two year minimum.
public health demands vaccinations	1456	NoArgument	They are lying.
public health demands vaccinations	1457	NoArgument	HERE IS THE CAPTURE OF THEIR OWN POLICY, FROM THEIR OWN STATE WEB SITE:.
public health demands vaccinations	1458	Argument_against	FACT: Vaccines screwed up alfie, caused a brain wasting disorder, (all kids get knocked down by vaccines now, which are eugenics weapons) and the ones who take it worst die like Alfie.
public health demands vaccinations	1459	NoArgument	Only Alfie did not die from the vaccine itself, he died because they cut off food.
public health demands vaccinations	1460	NoArgument	They cut off food, because once he hit age 2, he had rights!
public health demands vaccinations	1461	NoArgument	They could not have that happening.
public health demands vaccinations	1462	NoArgument	I don’t think the British government was worried about the payout for damage, and they probably will pay out because this is such a high profile story.
public health demands vaccinations	1463	Argument_against	I believe the british government was in fact worried because this was such obvious vaccine damage, and they don’t want anyone investigating a weapon they want to keep on using.
public health demands vaccinations	1464	NoArgument	If Alfie hit 2, he’d have crossed that threshold.
public health demands vaccinations	1465	NoArgument	Vaccine strain of measles found in measles outbreaks: genetic testing reveals forensic evidence of outbreak source | ACGR's News with Attitude.
public health demands vaccinations	1466	Argument_against	If you’re worried about your child contracting measles, whooping cough or one of the other scary-sounding infectious diseases being hyped up by the mainstream media right now, you might want to steer clear of recently vaccinated children rather than the unvaccinated.
public health demands vaccinations	1467	Argument_against	What you’re not being told by the corporate media is that attenuated vaccines like MMR, the proposed solution to the contrived Disneyland measles outbreak, shed live viruses for weeks or even months following vaccination, spreading vaccine-strain infections to others.
public health demands vaccinations	1468	Argument_against	Both vaccinated and unvaccinated children alike are at risk from recently vaccinated children, who are walking disease carriers spreading viruses and, in some cases, triggering disease outbreaks.
public health demands vaccinations	1469	NoArgument	This is never spoken about by the sell-out talking heads on TV, but it’s a scientific fact that simply can’t be ignored in light of the current national conversation on vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1470	NoArgument	Practicing nephrologist, or kidney specialist, Dr. Suzanne Humphries spoke about this during a recent lecture, in which she highlighted the technological advancements that have allowed for vaccine-strain viruses to be identified in children.
public health demands vaccinations	1471	NoArgument	“They looked at, with this DNA and genetic fingerprinting, what strains they were and it was the vaccine strain that they were infected with.
public health demands vaccinations	1472	Argument_against	So not only did they become sick from measles from the strain that they were vaccinated with, but they were contagious.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1473	NoArgument	A short video clip of Dr. Humphries explaining vaccine shedding is available here:.
public health demands vaccinations	1474	Argument_against	Canadian girl develops vaccine-strain measles infection more than a month after vaccination.
public health demands vaccinations	1475	Argument_against	The Croatian study referenced by Dr. Humphries focuses on a child vaccinated with MMR who tested positive more than a week later with a vaccine strain of measles known as Schwarz, which is contagious .
public health demands vaccinations	1476	NoArgument	The child’s symptoms were initially thought to be rubella, and if it weren’t for proper testing, the diagnosis probably would have remained as such.
public health demands vaccinations	1477	Argument_against	Several other studies have also documented cases of vaccine-induced infection with measles, including a two-year-old Canadian girl who in late 2013 was found to have developed the earliest symptoms of vaccine-induced measles 37 days after she was vaccinated .
public health demands vaccinations	1478	NoArgument	“Because we now have this added surveillance and new technology… we can distinguish between strains,” added Dr. Humphries.
public health demands vaccinations	1479	Argument_for	“We used to think that measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines didn’t shed and didn’t cause disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1480	NoArgument	But now we’re finding that for all three of them, not only is the immune response not what we thought, but that for rubella and measles at least, those people are shedding virus.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1481	Argument_against	Unvaccinated children contracting deadly viruses from “shedding” vaccinated children.
public health demands vaccinations	1482	NoArgument	As it concerns the ongoing Disneyland measles outbreak, the assumption is that an unvaccinated person must have triggered it, and that unvaccinated people are now continuing to spread it.
public health demands vaccinations	1483	Argument_against	More than likely, the exact opposite is true , as those recently vaccinated with MMR have been scientifically proven to carry around the three vaccine viruses and possibly spread them to others.
public health demands vaccinations	1484	NoArgument	Healthy, unvaccinated children, it is important to note, aren’t just carrying around measles infection like we’ve all been led to believe.
public health demands vaccinations	1485	Argument_against	The only people who would have the disease in their bodies would be the recently vaccinated, or perhaps those who recently traveled overseas and somehow brought it back without showing symptoms (which is less likely).
public health demands vaccinations	1486	NoArgument	“[I]t is not likely that the mainstream media ‘TV doctors’ will even discuss this as they falsely vilify parents who choose not to administer the MMR vaccine to their children as the cause of these outbreaks,” explains Health Impact News.
public health demands vaccinations	1487	NoArgument	Did the Government Cover Up an Autism/Vaccine Connection? | ACGR's News with Attitude.
public health demands vaccinations	1488	Argument_against	For years, parents of autistic children have claimed a link between their children’s condition and vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1489	Argument_against	One vaccine in particular has been mentioned : the MMR (Mumps, Measles, and Rubella), which has a record of side effects , some severe.
public health demands vaccinations	1490	Argument_for	The Center for Disease Control of the United States has consistently denied any MMR/autism connection.
public health demands vaccinations	1491	NoArgument	In congressional testimony and elsewhere, it has consistently cited a 2004 study of its own published in Pediatrics.
public health demands vaccinations	1492	NoArgument	Now one of the authors of that study, William W. Thompson, a senior scientist employed by the CDC, has admitted that critical data from the study was suppressed.
public health demands vaccinations	1493	Argument_against	That data suggested a link between the MMR and autism when the vaccination is done at the recommended age, especially among infant African-American males.
public health demands vaccinations	1494	Argument_against	This is what Dr Thompson himself says in his statement: “The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1495	NoArgument	One scientist, Dr. Brian Hooker, sought the complete study data for a decade and finally got it with the help of Congress.
public health demands vaccinations	1496	Argument_against	He reported that the raw data suggested a 340% increase in autism among African-American males vaccinated at the recommended age.
public health demands vaccinations	1497	NoArgument	Others have already challenged this number, and it is still unclear exactly what the newly revealed data will show.
public health demands vaccinations	1498	NoArgument	What is clear and indisputable, however, is that a respected CDC researcher has alleged that the agency intentionally withheld important data from a critical study and then cited that study in testimony to Congress.
public health demands vaccinations	1499	NoArgument	Based on Dr. Thompson’s story, it could be that African-American newborns were subsequently exposed to unnecessary risk.
public health demands vaccinations	1500	NoArgument	Dr. Thompson told Dr. Hooker over the phone: “It’s the lowest part of my career, that I went along with that paper.” Thompson revealed that he did not know Dr. Hooker was recording the conversation but did not deny making the statement.
public health demands vaccinations	1501	NoArgument	Dr. Thompson also acknowledged, in a statement released by his lawyer , “I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics.
public health demands vaccinations	1502	Argument_against	The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1503	NoArgument	This statement, released on August 27, confirms that important data was withheld for ten years.
public health demands vaccinations	1504	NoArgument	What remains to be seen is what honest science would tell us, in the unlikely event we ever get honest science out of the government.
public health demands vaccinations	1505	NoArgument	The CDC has claimed that the case against vaccines is closed.
public health demands vaccinations	1506	NoArgument	Quite apart from Dr. Thompson’s startling new testimony, there have been reasons to doubt this.
public health demands vaccinations	1507	NoArgument	For example, a review of the literature in Immunotoxicoloy by the respected researcher Helen Ratajczak has raised many questions.
public health demands vaccinations	1508	NoArgument	Dr. Thompson agrees that there are questions that need answering.
public health demands vaccinations	1509	NoArgument	I will do everything I can to assist any unbiased and objective scientists inside or outside the CDC to analyze data collected by the CDC or other public organizations for the purpose of understanding whether vaccines are associated with an increased risk of autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1510	NoArgument	There are still more questions than answers, and I appreciate that so many families are looking for answers from the scientific community.
public health demands vaccinations	1511	NoArgument	CDC whistleblower tells the world he was ordered to lie by CDC officials | ACGR's News with Attitude.
public health demands vaccinations	1512	NoArgument	A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist-turned-whistleblower says the government’s premier health research agency forced him to lie about the negative health effects of vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1513	Argument_against	In a video posted here , Dr. William Thompson accused the CDC of more than a decade of cover-ups regarding the link between vaccines and childhood autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1514	NoArgument	“CDC is paralyzed; the whole system is paralyzed right now,” Thompson is heard telling Dr. Brian Hooker, Ph.D., during a phone conversation.
public health demands vaccinations	1515	NoArgument	“The whole branch is paralyzed, and it’s become more paralyzed.
public health demands vaccinations	1516	NoArgument	So, there’s less, and less, and less being done, as the place just comes to a grinding halt.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1517	NoArgument	He went on to say that the CDC has put research “10 years behind.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1518	NoArgument	“Because the CDC has not been transparent,” he added, “we’ve missed 10 years of research, because the CDC is so paralyzed right now by anything related to autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1519	NoArgument	“Really, what they [the CDC] need is for Congress to come in and, you know, say, ‘give us the data, and we’re going to have an independent contractor do it,’ then bring in the autism advocates and have them intimately involved in the studies.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1520	NoArgument	Dr. Thompson said that he has “a boss who’s asking” him “to lie,” but he added that, were he forced to provide testimony for the record, he would do so and would do so truthfully.
public health demands vaccinations	1521	NoArgument	Dr. Thompson — and others — are urging Americans to contact their elected leaders and ask them to delve into what the CDC knows about the vaccine-autism link but has been reluctant to discuss.

public health demands vaccinations	1525	Argument_against	“The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism .
public health demands vaccinations	1526	NoArgument	Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed,” Dr. Thompson said, according to his statement.
public health demands vaccinations	1527	NoArgument	And while he went on to say that he generally supports vaccinating children, “My concern has been the decision to omit relevant findings in a particular study for a particular sub group for a particular vaccine .”.
public health demands vaccinations	1528	Argument_against	“There have always been recognized risks for vaccination and I believe it is the responsibility of the CDC to properly convey the risks associated with receipt of those vaccines,” he said.
public health demands vaccinations	1529	NoArgument	‘Still more questions than answers’.
public health demands vaccinations	1530	NoArgument	Dr. Thompson said he had shared his concerns with Dr. Hooker for many months prior to going public with his information.
public health demands vaccinations	1531	NoArgument	But he said he was not aware that Hooker was recording the conversations, “nor was I given any choice regarding whether my name would be made public or my voice would be put on the Internet.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1532	NoArgument	“I am providing information to Congressman William Posey, and of course will continue to cooperate with Congress,” Dr. Thompson further stated.

public health demands vaccinations	1537	NoArgument	Rhode Island mandates 7th graders get dangerous HPV vaccine – adverse reactions hidden from parents | ACGR's News with Attitude.
public health demands vaccinations	1538	NoArgument	It was announced this week that 7th graders in Rhode Island would be required to have the Gardasil HPV vaccine as a requirement for attending school.
public health demands vaccinations	1539	Argument_for	Starting this fall, seventh-graders in all public and private schools will be required to get a vaccine that protects against a sexually transmitted virus linked to various genital cancers, especially cervical cancer in women.
public health demands vaccinations	1540	NoArgument	Students who fail to get the vaccine for HPV — or the human papillomavirus — will be precluded from attending school unless their parents seek an exemption for medical or religious reasons.
public health demands vaccinations	1541	Argument_against	The HPV vaccine has become very controversial, particularly outside of the United States, due to the large amount of injuries being attributed to the vaccine, and in some cases, also deaths.
public health demands vaccinations	1542	Argument_against	Sadly, parents are generally not warned about the serious adverse reactions to the vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1543	Argument_against	Locally, some parents are already agitating against the vaccine, saying it’s an intrusion by the government into private matters and that the vaccine’s side effects can be serious.
public health demands vaccinations	1544	Argument_for	But Tricia Washburn, chief of the office of immunization for the Rhode Island Department of Health, said the vaccine has been thoroughly studied by the Centers for Disease Control, which monitors adverse outcomes, and no safety concerns were found.
public health demands vaccinations	1545	NoArgument	The CDC has shown that they cannot be trusted for information on vaccine safety, due to a serious conflict of interest as they are the largest purchaser of vaccines in the world, buying billions of dollars worth of vaccines each year.
public health demands vaccinations	1546	NoArgument	(See: CDC’s Purchase of $4 Billion of Vaccines a Conflict of Interest in Overseeing Vaccine Safety .).
public health demands vaccinations	1547	Argument_against	Countries outside of the U.S. have stopped recommending the vaccine, and launched investigations regarding the widespread reports of crippling vaccine injuries due to the HPV vaccine, such as the recent European Medicines Agency probe that just started a few weeks ago.
public health demands vaccinations	1548	Argument_against	(See: European Medicines Agency Launches Probe into HPV Vaccine Injuries.
public health demands vaccinations	1549	Argument_against	One of the most serious side effects being reported by those harmed by the HPV Gardasil vaccine is premature menopause, or what the medical community labels as “Primary Ovarian Failure.”

public health demands vaccinations	1555	NoArgument	Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations – Should Their Views be Silenced?
public health demands vaccinations	1556	NoArgument	One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all “quacks.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1557	NoArgument	However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate.
public health demands vaccinations	1558	Argument_against	Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding “the science” of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1559	Argument_against	The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all.
public health demands vaccinations	1560	Argument_for	And those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary.
public health demands vaccinations	1561	NoArgument	Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field.
public health demands vaccinations	1562	NoArgument	In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position.
public health demands vaccinations	1563	Argument_against	Many doctors who consider themselves “pro-vaccine,” for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual.
public health demands vaccinations	1564	NoArgument	Many doctors recommend a “delayed” vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule.
public health demands vaccinations	1565	Argument_against	Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot.
public health demands vaccinations	1566	NoArgument	These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions.
public health demands vaccinations	1567	NoArgument	In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

public health demands vaccinations	1579	NoArgument	Here are some links.
public health demands vaccinations	1580	NoArgument	Thats impossible.
public health demands vaccinations	1581	Argument_against	The inventor of the flu vaccine said it would NEVER work because the flu virus mutates and changes every year.
public health demands vaccinations	1582	NoArgument	They have absolutely no idea what strain will come up next year.
public health demands vaccinations	1583	Argument_against	Therefor it's 100% impossible to make a vaccine for next years mutated flu virus.
public health demands vaccinations	1584	NoArgument	Straight from the flu vaccine makers mouth.
public health demands vaccinations	1585	NoArgument	Somebody just bought his patent and has been making mega Billions every year since.
public health demands vaccinations	1586	NoArgument	Vaccines and Retroviruses: A Whistleblower Reveals What the Government Is Hiding – Abel Danger.
public health demands vaccinations	1587	NoArgument	Data suggests that 6% of the U.S. population is harboring a retrovirus in their bodies that can develop into an acquired immune deficiency.
public health demands vaccinations	1588	NoArgument	This is not the well-known AIDS caused by HIV, but Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) associated with other retroviruses.
public health demands vaccinations	1589	NoArgument	These non-HIV retroviruses were unintentionally introduced into humans over the past 75 years.
public health demands vaccinations	1590	NoArgument	It began with trials of polio vaccines and yellow fever vaccines given in the early 1930s.
public health demands vaccinations	1591	NoArgument	This is when the first recorded cases of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and autism appeared.
public health demands vaccinations	1592	NoArgument	It involved the use of laboratory mice to prepare vaccines for human use.
public health demands vaccinations	1593	NoArgument	20 Million Americans Likely Infected with Retroviruses.
public health demands vaccinations	1594	Argument_against	Retrovirus exposure intensified in the 1970s as new vaccines and pharmaceutical products were developed and these retroviruses, and related infectious agents, are now associated with dozens of modern chronic illnesses – perhaps nearly all of them.
public health demands vaccinations	1595	NoArgument	In these diseases, infection leads to inflammation – and unresolved inflammation can lead to chronic disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1596	NoArgument	The list of diseases stretches from autism to cancer and from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome to Alzheimer’s.
public health demands vaccinations	1597	NoArgument	The diseases cripple the development of the young, steal the productivity and enjoyment of life for adults, and provide a slow and withering death to the elderly.
public health demands vaccinations	1598	NoArgument	“An inefficient virus kills its host.
public health demands vaccinations	1599	NoArgument	A clever virus stays with it.” –James Lovelock.
public health demands vaccinations	1600	NoArgument	The retroviruses being discussed are very clever and very stealthy.
public health demands vaccinations	1601	NoArgument	They can infect a person and stay with them for their entire lifetime.
public health demands vaccinations	1602	NoArgument	Sometimes they shorten life substantially.
public health demands vaccinations	1603	NoArgument	But, they are just as likely to bring a person to total disability and deny people the opportunity for a normal life.
public health demands vaccinations	1604	NoArgument	Even though 20 million Americans are likely to be infected, not everyone will develop serious illness.
public health demands vaccinations	1605	NoArgument	Retroviruses in the human body are like sleeping giants.
public health demands vaccinations	1606	NoArgument	They are quiet until they are activated in immune deficient people.
public health demands vaccinations	1607	NoArgument	Once activated, they create diseases such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, also called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Chronic Lyme’s Disease, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), numerous cancers, and a wide range of other autoimmune, neuroimmune, and central nervous system diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1608	NoArgument	Please see reference number 2 at the end of this article for a comprehensive list of diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1609	NoArgument	Retroviruses Can Promote a Perfect Storm of Illness.
public health demands vaccinations	1610	NoArgument	The retroviruses being discussed here do not directly cause diseases by themselves.
public health demands vaccinations	1611	NoArgument	A perfect storm of events need to come together to create acquired immune system deficiency (non-HIV AIDS).
public health demands vaccinations	1612	NoArgument	When conditions are right, the viruses create unrelenting inflammatory processes that disrupt the immune system.
public health demands vaccinations	1613	NoArgument	The perfect storm occurs when human DNA is disturbed by retroviruses, when there are co-infections, when there is severe shock or trauma, when hormones are dysregulated, when there are genetically modified organisms and glyphosate in the diet, when there are pesticides and other toxic substances in food and the environment, and when there are genetic susceptibilities.
public health demands vaccinations	1614	NoArgument	If some or all of these conditions occur together, then the immune system will be weakened to the point where the perfect storm occurs, and people become ill with some type of modern chronic disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1615	NoArgument	Not everyone who has retroviruses in their bodies will develop one of these diseases, but for those who experience a perfect storm the possibility is much greater.
public health demands vaccinations	1616	NoArgument	The risks increase with age as the immune system naturally weakens.
public health demands vaccinations	1617	NoArgument	How Did These Viruses Infect Millions Worldwide?
public health demands vaccinations	1618	Argument_against	These (retro)viruses were most likely introduced into humans through contaminated vaccines and biological products including GMOs, human blood products, the milk of cows, and human breast milk.
public health demands vaccinations	1619	NoArgument	These retroviruses can be passed between family members through body fluids.
public health demands vaccinations	1620	NoArgument	It is not unusual to find a family where everyone tests positive for a retrovirus, but only one person is experiencing a retrovirus-related illness.
public health demands vaccinations	1621	NoArgument	Symptom free carriers are common in human retroviral infections.
public health demands vaccinations	1622	NoArgument	You Probably Haven’t Heard Much About the Retrovirus Problem.
public health demands vaccinations	1623	NoArgument	If you have never heard about the retrovirus problem, then you can thank the CDC, NIH, FDA, and other government agencies for covering up the problem since it was first reported to them in 1991 by American immunologist Elaine DeFreitas.
public health demands vaccinations	1624	NoArgument	They did not want to alarm you.
public health demands vaccinations	1625	NoArgument	They didn’t want to induce a panic, or a rebellion against the use of vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1626	NoArgument	They didn’t want to send shock waves through the conventional medical care system and the pharmaceutical industry that would threaten their profits.
public health demands vaccinations	1627	NoArgument	They didn’t want to risk a public panic among people needing blood transfusions.
public health demands vaccinations	1628	NoArgument	They didn’t want to disturb the resolve of Big Pharma and political leaders working to pass mandatory vaccination laws.
public health demands vaccinations	1629	NoArgument	They didn’t want to interfere with the full implementation of genetically engineered crops.
public health demands vaccinations	1630	NoArgument	They didn’t want to lay the groundwork for numerous class action lawsuits from people who were harmed or who will be harmed in the next 20 to 30 years as the retroviruses continue to multiply in the bodies of infected persons.
public health demands vaccinations	1631	NoArgument	Ultimately, government leaders didn’t want us to be able to make informed decisions regarding the true risks associated with certain therapies – they preferred to keep us all in the dark.
public health demands vaccinations	1632	NoArgument	They just wanted to cover up the whole mess and act as if it never happened – but it did happen, and millions of Americans are now suffering from a plague of modern diseases that were once rare or non-existent.
public health demands vaccinations	1633	NoArgument	My Sources for This Information.
public health demands vaccinations	1634	NoArgument	The information that I am sharing in this article came mostly from an interview I did with Judy A. Mikovitz, Ph.D. and from the book, Plague: One Scientist’s Intrepid Search for the Truth about Human Retroviruses and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Autism, and Other Diseases, written by Kent Heckenlively, JD, and Dr. Mikovitz.
public health demands vaccinations	1635	NoArgument	My article will explain the history of retrovirus contamination and the government cover-up.
public health demands vaccinations	1636	NoArgument	It attempts to do what our government didn’t have the political courage to do.
public health demands vaccinations	1637	NoArgument	Retroviruses Escaped Safeguards Designed to Contain Them.
public health demands vaccinations	1638	Argument_for	Before I go any further, I need to tell you that safeguards most likely were implemented in December of 2014 to clean up retrovirus contaminated blood products and vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1639	NoArgument	The FDA approved technologies developed by the Cerus Corporation on that date that were specifically designed to solve these problems.
public health demands vaccinations	1640	NoArgument	The problem was well understood by public health scientists and researchers for five years, but the problem was not made public until the FDA approved a solution.
public health demands vaccinations	1641	NoArgument	The press release from the Cerus Corporation describes some of the problems with the blood supply, and tells us about their new technologies.
public health demands vaccinations	1642	Argument_for	[4] This is good news for people who are choosing to take vaccines and for those who need to receive blood products that Dr. Mikovits proved that this new technology is effective for inactivating these viruses in blood products, even though as you will soon read, she was viciously persecuted for bringing this problem to light.
public health demands vaccinations	1643	NoArgument	PRESS RELEASE DETAILS: FDA APPROVES INTERCEPT BLOOD SYSTEM FOR PLASMA [3].
public health demands vaccinations	1644	NoArgument	However, we must not forget the large number of people who were unknowingly infected by retroviruses over the past 20 or 30 years.
public health demands vaccinations	1645	NoArgument	The Cerus technology will not help them.
public health demands vaccinations	1646	NoArgument	How Did the Retrovirus Nightmare Begin?
public health demands vaccinations	1647	NoArgument	The most recent chapter of the story began in the 1970s.
public health demands vaccinations	1648	NoArgument	It took place in research laboratories throughout the world where scientists were doing research on diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS.
public health demands vaccinations	1649	NoArgument	These were the same laboratories where they were manufacturing vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1650	NoArgument	These labs work with mice that are genetically engineered to have immune system deficiencies, which made them vulnerable to express certain diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1651	NoArgument	In other words, their immune systems have been altered in such a way that they will get a certain disease when exposed to a certain pathogen or toxin.
public health demands vaccinations	1652	NoArgument	Research activities involved injecting lab mice with human viruses to attenuate or weaken the viruses.
public health demands vaccinations	1653	NoArgument	Scientists routinely did these experiments with mice in the same laboratories where they were growing human cell lines.
public health demands vaccinations	1654	NoArgument	They believed that mouse viruses and human viruses would not interact, or travel from one part of the research facility to another.
public health demands vaccinations	1655	NoArgument	In the past, scientists didn’t worry about mouse virus contamination, because they believed that these viruses would not harm humans if they actually made their way into a human being.
public health demands vaccinations	1656	Argument_for	Scientists acknowledged the risks, but maintained the judgment that the benefits of vaccines outweighed the risks.
public health demands vaccinations	1657	NoArgument	The work of Dr. Mikovitz and other scientists challenged their beliefs.
public health demands vaccinations	1658	NoArgument	They suggested the problem with mouse viruses was already out of control and the cost of the damage could destroy the economies of nations.
public health demands vaccinations	1659	NoArgument	Other Doctors Who Warned About Retroviruses.
public health demands vaccinations	1660	NoArgument	Dr. G. Stuart made the same warning in 1953, when he spoke to the World Health Organization.
public health demands vaccinations	1661	NoArgument	He was talking about the yellow fever vaccine at that time.
public health demands vaccinations	1662	Argument_against	Two main objections to the yellow fever vaccine have been voiced, because of the possibility that (i) the mouse brain employed in its preparation may be contaminated with a virus pathogenic for man although latent in mice … Or may be the cause of a de-myelinating encephalomyelitis; (ii) the use, as an antigen, or a virus with enhanced neurotropic properties may be followed by serious reactions involving the central nervous system.
public health demands vaccinations	1663	NoArgument	In 1996, Dr. John Coffin, a leading expert on recombination in viruses, warned against transplanting cells from animals into humans to improve the functioning of the immune system of HIV-AIDS patients.
public health demands vaccinations	1664	NoArgument	The infection is a virtually inevitable consequence of xenotransplantation and this is a very serious worry because the animals that have been chosen for doing this — the baboon and the pig — are both known to carry endogenous viruses, replication competent, but very poorly studied, that are capable of infecting human cells.
public health demands vaccinations	1665	NoArgument	Dr. Judy Mikovitz and Other Scientists Discover Retroviruses Now Present in 6% of Americans.
public health demands vaccinations	1666	NoArgument	The long held judgement of the majority of the scientific community was proven wrong in 2009 by Dr. Judy Mikovitz and other scientists who discovered that something unexpected and very harmful was happening in laboratories throughout America and the world.
public health demands vaccinations	1667	NoArgument	They discovered that a retrovirus called XMRV (xenotropic murine retrovirus) and other related retroviruses were now present in 6% of Americans and that this retrovirus was appearing in a very high percentage of people with diseases such as prostate cancer, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, autism, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, treatment resistant Lyme’s Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1668	NoArgument	The term “xenotropic” indicates that the virus had a non-human origin and it is now able to live and multiply in humans.
public health demands vaccinations	1669	NoArgument	This retrovirus had an appearance that was similar to mouse virus, but it also had qualities of human virus.
public health demands vaccinations	1670	NoArgument	It was a chimera – like a mythical beast – part human and part mouse.
public health demands vaccinations	1671	NoArgument	It was accidentally created in laboratories when a naturally occurring mouse virus recombined with a human virus found in a prostate cancer culture.
public health demands vaccinations	1672	NoArgument	This would be confirmed in 2011 by European researchers.
public health demands vaccinations	1673	NoArgument	Their 2011 article stated:. One of the most widely distributed biological products that frequently involved mouse tissue, at least up until recent years, is vaccines, especially vaccines against viruses...
public health demands vaccinations	1674	Argument_against	It is possible that XMRV particles were present in virus stocks cultured in mouse cells for vaccine production, and that the virus was transferred to the human population by vaccination.
public health demands vaccinations	1675	NoArgument	Retroviruses Released into the Air and Escape Laboratories.
public health demands vaccinations	1676	NoArgument	What scientists didn’t realize was the way they managed their mouse colonies and managed the production of their human cell lines created conditions in laboratories where viruses could unexpectedly mutate and recombine with one another.
public health demands vaccinations	1677	NoArgument	Even more astounding was the fact that these retroviruses could easily reproduce themselves and travel through the air.
public health demands vaccinations	1678	NoArgument	Up until 2009, scientists didn’t know that retroviruses could be aerosolized.
public health demands vaccinations	1679	NoArgument	Retroviruses that were in mice were being released into the air and traveling through their facilities to other labs where human cell lines were being cultivated.
public health demands vaccinations	1680	NoArgument	They became part of the cells and part of the products that were made from the activity of the cell lines, such as the antigens used in vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1681	NoArgument	The retroviruses also infected lab workers.
public health demands vaccinations	1682	NoArgument	Thus far, I have provided some very basic information about retroviruses – where they came from and how they facilitate human disease — but there is much more to the story.
public health demands vaccinations	1683	NoArgument	We need to explore why the U.S. government doesn’t want you to know that many strains of retroviruses exist, and why they don’t want you to suspect that they are making you sick.
public health demands vaccinations	1684	NoArgument	I recently spoke with Dr. Judy A. Mikovitz, Ph.D., to gather her inside perspective about these questions.
public health demands vaccinations	1685	NoArgument	Dr. Mikovitz has dedicated her life to being a research scientist in honor of her grandfather who died of cancer when she was a teenager.
public health demands vaccinations	1686	NoArgument	Dr. Mikovitz earned her BA from University of Virginia and PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from George Washington University.
public health demands vaccinations	1687	NoArgument	In her 35-year quest to understand and discover ways to treat chronic diseases, she has studied immunology, natural products chemistry, epigenetics, virology and drug development.
public health demands vaccinations	1688	NoArgument	In just over twenty years she rose from an entry-level lab technician to become director of the lab of Antiviral Drug Mechanisms at the National Cancer Institute before leaving to direct the Cancer Biology program at EpiGenX Pharmaceuticals in Santa Barbara, California.
public health demands vaccinations	1689	NoArgument	There in 2006, she became attracted to the plight of patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1690	NoArgument	In only five years she developed the first neuroimmune institute from a concept to a reality and is primarily responsible for demonstrating the relationship between immune-based inflammation and these diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1691	NoArgument	She has published over 50 scientific papers.
public health demands vaccinations	1692	NoArgument	I asked Dr. Mikovits to summarize the retrovirus controversy and the government’s effort to cover-up the existence of certain retroviruses.
public health demands vaccinations	1693	NoArgument	Evidence of retroviruses is found in 6% of the population – 20 million Americans.
public health demands vaccinations	1694	Argument_against	Retrovirus were introduced through the blood supply and vaccines into the human population.
public health demands vaccinations	1695	NoArgument	These viruses are associated with many diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1696	NoArgument	They want you to believe that gammaretroviruses are all gone… [10].
public health demands vaccinations	1697	NoArgument	Dr. Mikovitz’s Career Destroyed for Telling the Truth.
public health demands vaccinations	1698	NoArgument	Dr. Mikovitz is not just one of the leading scientists in the area of retrovirus related illness, she stands at the center of a scientific controversy and political battle that has ended her career as a government-funded research scientist.
public health demands vaccinations	1699	Argument_against	She spoke the truth about the fraudulent use of government research money, the marketing of inaccurate retrovirus tests, Medicare fraud, the contaminated blood supply, and the harm that is associated with vaccines and their schedule of administration.
public health demands vaccinations	1700	NoArgument	Her research showed how retroviruses are linked to the plague of modern illnesses that are bankrupting the U.S. healthcare system.
public health demands vaccinations	1701	NoArgument	The result of her unwavering determination to stick to the truth of her research and to stand up against those who want to keep the truth hidden, resulted in her being taken to criminal court and civil court.
public health demands vaccinations	1702	NoArgument	She was gagged for four years by fabricated criminal charges in Nevada, and could not speak openly about retrovirus science or the government cover-up without risking further persecution/prosecution.
public health demands vaccinations	1703	NoArgument	The unfolding of the saga began in the summer of 2009 when she attended a meeting of scientists from the highest levels of the scientific community.
public health demands vaccinations	1704	NoArgument	All the government agencies involved with matters of human health were represented.
public health demands vaccinations	1705	NoArgument	Leaders from various research institutes and universities were present.
public health demands vaccinations	1706	NoArgument	They were experts in the field of virology and disease prevention and treatment.
public health demands vaccinations	1707	NoArgument	(See the reference at the end of this article for the list of participants.)
public health demands vaccinations	1708	NoArgument	During the time allotted to Dr. Mikovitz, she described the results of her most recent research that would soon be published in the esteemed journal, Science.
public health demands vaccinations	1709	NoArgument	She drew an association between the XMRV mouse retrovirus and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
public health demands vaccinations	1710	NoArgument	Two months later Dr. Mikovitz and two other scientists presented evidence to the federal government that a retrovirus might underlie autism spectrum disorder.
public health demands vaccinations	1711	NoArgument	When her article about gammaretroviruses and myalgic encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) was published in October of 2009, it did not trigger government health officials to explain it to the public.
public health demands vaccinations	1712	NoArgument	Instead of acclaim, a vicious attack was launched against the findings of the presence of retrovirus in patients who had ME/CFS.
public health demands vaccinations	1713	NoArgument	The attack was largely led by the psychiatric industry.
public health demands vaccinations	1714	NoArgument	They strenuously objected to a viral association with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
public health demands vaccinations	1715	NoArgument	They believed that ME/CFS was a mental illness without a physical cause.
public health demands vaccinations	1716	NoArgument	They believed that talk therapy and psychiatric drugs were the only answer for those who were disabled by this retroviral disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1717	NoArgument	They held to their belief even when patients required oxygen to survive and rarely had the strength to leave their homes because of intense weakness and pain.
public health demands vaccinations	1718	NoArgument	A Wake-up Call to the Retrovirus Problem.
public health demands vaccinations	1719	NoArgument	At the 1st and only International Workshop on the XMRV retrovirus, held in September of 2010, Dr. Mikovitz and a group of other scientist presented research that would become the basis for conducting an international multi-center study on XMRV retroviruses.
public health demands vaccinations	1720	NoArgument	Among the research discussed at the meeting, was a study involving rhesus macaque monkeys that were exposed to XMRV.
public health demands vaccinations	1721	NoArgument	This was particularly valuable.
public health demands vaccinations	1722	NoArgument	It showed that the XMRV retrovirus quickly disappeared from the blood stream after exposure — presumably going into tissues.
public health demands vaccinations	1723	Argument_for	Vaccines led to the eradication of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans.
public health demands vaccinations	1724	NoArgument	The immune stimulant they used was an injection of bolus peptides that mimicked a vaccination.
public health demands vaccinations	1725	NoArgument	This provoked the virus and caused it to replicate to detectable levels, and presumably cause disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1726	NoArgument	Another study presented findings about infectious XMRV in the peripheral blood of children and their parents.
public health demands vaccinations	1727	NoArgument	The study contained 66 subjects: 37 parents and 29 children.
public health demands vaccinations	1728	NoArgument	17 children had autism, a pair of twins had Niemann-Pick Type C (a neurodegenerative disorder), and 10 children were healthy siblings.
public health demands vaccinations	1729	NoArgument	The families lived in 11 different states.
public health demands vaccinations	1730	NoArgument	XMRV was detected in 55% of the people in the study.
public health demands vaccinations	1731	NoArgument	The age range of the infected children was 2 to 18 years.
public health demands vaccinations	1732	NoArgument	17 of the children (including the twins) were positive for XMRV (58%) and 20 of the 37 parents (54%) were positive for XMRV.
public health demands vaccinations	1733	NoArgument	14 of 17 autistic children were positive for XMRV (82%).
public health demands vaccinations	1734	NoArgument	They noted that autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ME/CFS, and childhood neuroimmune disorders share common.
public health demands vaccinations	1735	NoArgument	Fox News Panel Of Doctors Unanimously Agrees: Get Your Children Vaccinated.
public health demands vaccinations	1736	Argument_for	It is an unfortunate reality that many parents choose not to vaccinate their children, placing entire communities at risk to contract diseases many thought have long been gone from society.
public health demands vaccinations	1737	NoArgument	Recently, the state of California played host to the state’s worst whooping cough epidemic in 70 years.
public health demands vaccinations	1738	NoArgument	Between January 1 and November 26 2014, a total of 9,935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health — 1,819 in San Diego County alone.
public health demands vaccinations	1739	NoArgument	“We’d have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,” Dr. Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County, said of the outbreak.
public health demands vaccinations	1740	NoArgument	The state of California, and the country, has also seen a number of measles outbreaks as a result of parents electing not to vaccinate their children.
public health demands vaccinations	1741	Argument_for	“The current increase in measles cases is being driven by unvaccinated people, primarily U.S. residents, who got measles in other countries, brought the virus back to the United States and spread to others in communities where many people are not vaccinated,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general and director of CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, explained.
public health demands vaccinations	1742	NoArgument	“Many of the clusters in the U.S. began following travel to the Philippines where a large outbreak has been occurring since October 2013.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1743	Argument_for	The anti-vaccination movement is based entirely in fantasy.
public health demands vaccinations	1744	Argument_against	It began around 1998 when a study, later called an “elaborate fraud,” claimed that there was a link between autism and childhood vaccinations.
public health demands vaccinations	1745	Argument_against	Though the study was discredited and its author, Andrew Wakefield, was stripped of his medical license in 2011, True Believers continue to push the lie that vaccinations are hurting children.
public health demands vaccinations	1746	NoArgument	On Wednesday’s “Happening Now,” Fox News tackled the vaccination issue and the idea of the “personal liberty” to place one’s children, and entire communities, at risk by failing to take care of one’s kids’ most basic healthcare needs.
public health demands vaccinations	1747	NoArgument	Host Jenna Lee noted that “most Americans are vaccinating their kids,” but wondered if there was a problem with parents practicing their right to ignore science and make terrible decisions for their children.
public health demands vaccinations	1748	NoArgument	“There is a question,” Lee said, “about personal liberty and having the choice to make the choices for your children, and also what’s good for the community.” Lee asked her panel of doctors if there should be a federal regulation forcing parents to vaccinate their children if they will be in public areas.
public health demands vaccinations	1749	NoArgument	One by one, the doctors on the show destroyed the “personal liberty” narrative.
public health demands vaccinations	1750	Argument_for	“If we get into a philosophical argument about whether vaccines are safe are not — they are safe,” said Fox News doctor Manny Alvarez.
public health demands vaccinations	1751	Argument_for	He noted that parents who choose not to vaccinate are placing their children at risk.
public health demands vaccinations	1752	NoArgument	“If this is the trend that many communities are going to have — opting out because they have some weird belief, and I said that it’s weird because it is weird to me — that they’re not going to protect their children, then maybe we need a federal mandate,” Alvarez added.
public health demands vaccinations	1753	Argument_for	“This goes from being a personal decision to a public hazard if you’re not vaccinating your child,” Dr. Darria Long Gillespie said.
public health demands vaccinations	1754	NoArgument	If the trending outbreaks of measles and whooping cough continue, “We will need something from the top down to make sure that everyone stays vaccinated,” said Dr. Frank Esper, who pointed out that the United States once had federal mandates regarding vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1755	NoArgument	Some schools around the country are taking matters into their own hands.
public health demands vaccinations	1756	NoArgument	Last year, a federal judge upheld a New York City policy that prevents children who have not been vaccinated from attending school when another student has an illness that can be prevented by said vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1757	NoArgument	“Disease is pestilence,” said one of the plaintiffs in the case, “and pestilence is from the devil.
public health demands vaccinations	1758	NoArgument	The devil is germs and disease, which is cancer and any of those things that can take you down.
public health demands vaccinations	1759	NoArgument	But if you trust in the Lord, these things cannot come near you.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1760	NoArgument	In his ruling, Judge William F. Kuntz II said that the Supreme Court has “strongly suggested that religious objectors are not constitutionally exempt from vaccinations.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1761	NoArgument	Watch the Fox News segment, below:.
public health demands vaccinations	1762	Argument_against	Vaccine Deaths And Injuries Skyrocket As Cover-Up Implodes.
public health demands vaccinations	1763	Argument_against	Cases of debilitating illnesses, soft-kill side-effects and even instant deaths as a result of vaccinations across the world are skyrocketing as the cover-up of deadly inoculations implodes and more people than ever become suspicious about what they are being injected with by health authorities who have proven they cannot be trusted.
public health demands vaccinations	1764	Argument_for	The implosion of the vaccine cover-up is sure to encourage more parents from vaccinating their children in the coming months, with the swine flu shot now being combined with the regular seasonal flu jab.
public health demands vaccinations	1765	Argument_against	A recent Rasmussen poll found that 52 per cent of Americans were concerned about the safety of vaccines as we approach the start of school and college terms, where many children and teenagers will be “required” to take shots before they can attend.
public health demands vaccinations	1766	Argument_against	A global revolt against dangerous vaccines is brewing following a series of cases where children have been killed as a direct result of inoculations.
public health demands vaccinations	1767	Argument_against	A measles vaccination program in India was halted after four children died almost immediately after receiving the shot.

public health demands vaccinations	1770	NoArgument	London-Drug industry officials blamed for conspiring against people worldwide in the fraudulent World Health Organization swine flu campaign of 2009, are now linked to two murdered journalists.
public health demands vaccinations	1771	NoArgument	The conspiracy, in which a third of the officials on the emergency committee are now criminally implicated for promoting a false fright to sell billions of dollars of “required” vaccinations, extends worldwide.
public health demands vaccinations	1772	NoArgument	Additional American journalists are threatened in this developing story.
public health demands vaccinations	1773	NoArgument	The first writers to bring the “PharmaWHO” fright and fraud to light, Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz, and Jane Burgermeister, are both in serious jeopardy from related reprisals.
public health demands vaccinations	1774	NoArgument	Horowitz has been falsely framed in the recent murder of Britain’s leading financial whistleblower, Edward Harle (pen name, Christopher Story); while Burgermeister is now facing political imprisonment on the basis of false accusations that she is a “dangerous conspiracy theorist” in drug industry-corrupted Austria.
public health demands vaccinations	1775	NoArgument	“The companies and officials now indicted for the swine flu vaccination fraud are the ones Jane and I fingered from the beginning of BigPharma’s corrupt campaign,” Dr. Horowitz, the Editor-in-Chief of Medical Veritas journal, said.
public health demands vaccinations	1776	NoArgument	“Pharma hit-squads are now assassinating journalist/whistleblowers, and have the same agent provocateurs libeling Burgermeister and mehideously on the Internet and in person.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1777	NoArgument	Recently murdered journalists include Don Harkins, the editor of the Idaho Observer, America’s leading voice of BigPharma resistance, whose wife, Ingri Cassel, is the national director of Vaccination Liberation Organization.
public health demands vaccinations	1778	Argument_against	Harkins and Cassel were at the forefront of protecting people against drug industry corruption and risky vaccinations when Harkins was murdered with a dose of radiation, according to Cassel.
public health demands vaccinations	1779	NoArgument	The couple was befriended by suspects under investigation, including the one Harle argued was the murderer.
public health demands vaccinations	1780	NoArgument	Horowitz, who dedicated his film, PHARMAWHORES, as a memorial to Harkins’ life and friendship, has now been framed in Harle’s murder.
public health demands vaccinations	1781	NoArgument	Investigative journalist, Sherri Kane, who wrote for Fox News in Los Angeles, is also being vigorously libeled and physically threatened after reporting on Dr. Horowitz’s framers in Harle’s murder case.
public health demands vaccinations	1782	NoArgument	Kane is receiving threats from two persons identified among this network of disinformants–Timothy Patrick White, and a man named “Dr.
public health demands vaccinations	1783	NoArgument	True Ott”–that she is posting on her Latest Threats page in her blog.
public health demands vaccinations	1784	NoArgument	Timothy White similarly harassed ex-CIA agent Barbara Hartwell, who reported, “White made a deal with criminal government operatives and law enforcement personnel, for a get-out-of-jail-free card in 2002. .
public health demands vaccinations	1785	NoArgument	[He] seeks out any and every high profile whistleblower, patriot or investigator he hears about, reads about, or otherwise learns about.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1786	NoArgument	Since his release from prison, White has been involved in covert operations ranging from severe harassment, and issuing false murder charges, to discrediting whistle-blowers, Hartwell reports.
public health demands vaccinations	1787	NoArgument	Harle reported death threats from the Bush-Cheney/Rockefeller-directed CIA, days before his murder.
public health demands vaccinations	1788	NoArgument	Horowitz says he is “very clear” his libelers, linked through White to the CIA, have set him up to be killed as well.
public health demands vaccinations	1789	NoArgument	White was made a suspect by Ott in e-mails referencing Greg Szymanski (alias Eric Samuelson) as the source of Horowitz’s libel.
public health demands vaccinations	1790	NoArgument	Ott and Szymanskico-promote their “Bible Believer” theology on radio, and extensively in writings.
public health demands vaccinations	1791	NoArgument	Their subjects feature satanism in politics and the church, and they herald Eric John Phelps’s idea that Jews, Roman Catholics, and Jesuits are behind most problems in the world.
public health demands vaccinations	1792	NoArgument	Their international group of Bible Believers say they are persecuted as heretics, since, in Phelps’s words, he defends “the ability of Whites to build superior cultures, pagan or Bible-believing, over the other races,” in which he includes Jews.
public health demands vaccinations	1793	NoArgument	This highly-trained gang of professional agent provocateurs are now implicated in Harle’s and Harkins’s murders by way of the CIA’s link to White, and a young man’s murder linked to Bible Believers in BC, Canada.
public health demands vaccinations	1794	NoArgument	Hartwell published a lengthy report on White, whose history matches perfectly with the persecution Horowitz and Kane are getting by these racist agents.
public health demands vaccinations	1795	NoArgument	Szymanski and Ott generated the discrediting libel against Horowitz, claimed he was a “Knights of Malta” member, with Szymanski generating a false list of knights.
public health demands vaccinations	1796	NoArgument	Their extensive network of radical Bible Believers, based at Cloverdale Bibleway, in Surrey, BC, Canada, widely distributed Szymanski’s list and disinformation, setting Horowitz up to be assassinated by religious fanatics.
public health demands vaccinations	1797	NoArgument	The forged “Knights of Malta” list was used by journalist Benjamin Fulford, a Canadian working in Japan, linked to the “‘Black Dragon Society,’ which, folks, in case you didn’t know, are JAPANESE ASSASSINS,” Harle protested after receiving Fulford’s death threat.
public health demands vaccinations	1798	NoArgument	Fulford, previously with Forbes magazine, is widely known on the Internet for being personal friends with David Rockefeller.
public health demands vaccinations	1799	NoArgument	It is common knowledge that the Rockefeller family built the United Nations in New York City.
public health demands vaccinations	1800	Argument_against	David Rockefeller exercises extensive influence over the WHO and pharmaceutical industry–now proven to have defrauded the public to sell billions of dollars in risky, possibly deadly, H1N1 vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1801	NoArgument	NOTE TO JOURNALISTS: Sherri Kane and Dr. Leonard Horowitz are pleading to members of the press, and general public, to distribute and investigate this story, as their lives are being threatened.
public health demands vaccinations	1802	NoArgument	Ms. Kane’s blog(http://www.sherrikane.com/SherriKane.com/Blog.html) contains a lengthy detailed report.
public health demands vaccinations	1803	NoArgument	Dr. Horowitz has published his affidavit on this matter, available HERE (http://web.mac.com/len15/Newsletter_&_Blog/Knighting_Controversy.html).
public health demands vaccinations	1804	NoArgument	Following receipt of this article’s draft, Ms. Burgermeiseter wrote, “Dr.
public health demands vaccinations	1805	NoArgument	Horowitz and Sherri Kane have played a key role in informing people about the swine flu scam.
public health demands vaccinations	1806	NoArgument	They are being subjected to unprecedented harassment along with other swine flu whistleblowers like myself.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1807	NoArgument	Vaccines Covered In Republican Presidential Debate - Exposes Candidates’ Concern Over “Too Many Too Soon” - AGE OF AUTISM.
public health demands vaccinations	1808	NoArgument	From Canary Party:,Last night’s Republican Presidential Debate featured a discussion on vaccination in light of the Disneyland measles outbreak that went differently than the debate moderators anticipated.
public health demands vaccinations	1809	Argument_against	A question was posed to Dr. Ben Carson asking if Donald Trump should stop linking childhood vaccinations to autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1810	NoArgument	In the discussion that followed, Dr. Carson made the following statement, “….It is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time.
public health demands vaccinations	1811	NoArgument	And a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and, I think, are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that's appropriate.”
public health demands vaccinations	1812	NoArgument	Donald Trump added to the conversation that autism has become an epidemic and “has gotten totally out of control.”
public health demands vaccinations	1813	NoArgument	Mr. Trump then advocated for smaller doses of vaccines over a longer a period of time.
public health demands vaccinations	1814	NoArgument	Senator Rand Paul also chimed in, “I'm all for vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1815	NoArgument	But I'm also for freedom.
public health demands vaccinations	1816	NoArgument	I'm also a little concerned about how they're bunched up.
public health demands vaccinations	1817	Argument_for	My kids had all of their vaccines, and even if the science doesn't say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to have the right to spread my vaccines out a little bit at the very least.”
public health demands vaccinations	1818	NoArgument	The Canary Party thanks these three brave candidates, two of whom are physicians, for having an honest conversation about vaccination.
public health demands vaccinations	1819	Argument_against	We are especially grateful for their recognition that our country has an vaccination schedule that many parents see as too aggressive and rigid.
public health demands vaccinations	1820	Argument_for	In the inevitable, post-debate commentary, many pundits have attacked the candidates for their remarks, repeating the tired claims that all connections between autism and vaccines have been “discredited.”
public health demands vaccinations	1821	NoArgument	None of these pundits acknowledge the admissions of fraud by a CDC insider that have discredited the government-funded studies that have fed the propaganda campaigns in defense of the federally-protected vaccine program.
public health demands vaccinations	1822	NoArgument	Dr. William Thompson, a vaccine safety analyst at the CDC, admitted that he and his co-authors “omitted statistically significant information” in a 2004 study that would have associated the MMR vaccine with autism.
public health demands vaccinations	1823	NoArgument	Instead, they published a paper in 2004 that exonerated MMR and held a secret meeting in order to destroy the evidence of fraud.
public health demands vaccinations	1824	NoArgument	Another CDC-funded researcher, Dr. Poul Thorsen, participated in several of the studies that found no role for vaccines in autism and is currently on the Office of Inspector General’s “Most Wanted” list for fraud.
public health demands vaccinations	1825	Argument_against	Contrary to what is widely reported in the media, and by the former pharmaceutical executives at Autism Speaks, there is a great deal of research that does link vaccines and autism and explores the mechanisms by which this process can happen.
public health demands vaccinations	1826	NoArgument	We urge all candidates in the presidential election to review the research for themselves.
public health demands vaccinations	1827	NoArgument	We also call on them to heed the statement made by Congressman Bill Posey on the floor of the House of Representatives in July.
public health demands vaccinations	1828	Argument_against	Rep. Posey reported that Dr. Thompson had submitted a statement to his office testifying that his research team at CDC had gone to the lengths of bringing a garbage can into a meeting to throw away data that showed vaccine autism links so they would not have to include it in their findings.
public health demands vaccinations	1829	NoArgument	We ask that all candidates for higher office join Posey in calling for Congressional hearings into the scandal.
public health demands vaccinations	1830	NoArgument	The Canary Party will continue to work to support and educate those candidates who take vaccine safety seriously and who seek to continue to have open, honest and brave conversations on this critical issue.
public health demands vaccinations	1831	NoArgument	The Militarization of the CDC Zika, Money, Quarantine Power.
public health demands vaccinations	1832	NoArgument	In yet another end-round play by the Obama Administration, on Friday of Labor Day weekend where hot topics are dumped (Hillary Clinton’s email interview with the FBI) to go die before the next news cycle begins, it was announced that $300 million in “public health emergency” funding was earmarked for Japan’s Takeda to manufacture a new Zika vaccine.
public health demands vaccinations	1833	NoArgument	No need for Congress to vote on the appropriation; an executive order did the trick.
public health demands vaccinations	1834	NoArgument	The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which is helping the FDA screen donated blood against the Zika virus, was the agency from where President Obama found the $300 million in “emergency” funds to execute the backdoor deal.
public health demands vaccinations	1835	Argument_against	By offshoring the vaccine production, there will be zero Congressional oversight, while no U.S. media outlet or lawyer group will be able to discover, by invoking FOIA requests, what will be injected into that rushed Zika vaccine made in Japan.
public health demands vaccinations	1836	NoArgument	Even more perplexing than the CDC coup—who for a change didn’t want the publicity for their big move against the threat of Zika—was just five days earlier when Florida State University (FSU) announced a breakthrough to combat the mild African disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1837	NoArgument	But outside second tier media outlets, the mainstream press didn’t want to cover the solution to Zika.
public health demands vaccinations	1838	NoArgument	There is only one reason why the White House and the major media outlets didn’t trumpet the FSU discovery: It wasn’t the right solution.
public health demands vaccinations	1839	Argument_against	Indeed, this vaccine wasn't the right solution because if it were a efficiant vaccine, it would have received the red carpet, playing on the nightly news stations, while being hailed a conquering hero.
public health demands vaccinations	1840	NoArgument	The same week, CNN chose to cover the 3 million bees that were liquidated by the Zika spraying in South Carolina; yet chose not to cover the FSU breakthrough.
public health demands vaccinations	1841	NoArgument	What is up with that?
public health demands vaccinations	1842	NoArgument	Vaccine Deep State Flexes its Quarantine Might.
public health demands vaccinations	1843	NoArgument	The Vaccine Deep State, is a Monolith that consists of all the major health agencies, from the WHO, CDC, NIH, FDA, IOM, and others, with the vaccine makers, together with the mainstream news—bought off by Big Pharma in the form of advertising revenue—have no interest in a Zika breakthrough, unless that solution begins with a ‘V’.
public health demands vaccinations	1844	NoArgument	This revelation became clear when, also buried in mid August, the CDC via the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rolled out a proposed rule change.
public health demands vaccinations	1845	NoArgument	The 88-page document, Control of Communicable Diseases: Proposed Rule, (8-15-16, Vol 81, No 157, Federal Register), wants to grant the CDC full, super-constitutional powers in the event of a quarantine that only the health agency can call.
public health demands vaccinations	1846	NoArgument	The CDC wants to be granted full authority over all Americans during the event of a disease outbreak that leads to a mass quarantine.
public health demands vaccinations	1847	NoArgument	The document, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), is “open for comment” from the general public until October 14, 2016.
public health demands vaccinations	1848	NoArgument	Deftly trying to skirt around Congress—again—from dissecting the proposed rule changes, debating them, voting on them, and making some or all of them into law, such a flagrant power grab by the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) was designed to shrink the timeline for public discourse, while giving the appearance that the changes are minor, just simple adjustments from existing law on the agency’s limited authority in the event of a communicable disease emergency.
public health demands vaccinations	1849	NoArgument	Published in mid August and buried again during the noise of the presidential election three weeks before Americans vote, the NPRM, if approved, would elevate the CDC’s power to the Fourth military-intelligence agency in the United States, right behind the NSA, CIA, and the Department of Defense (DoD).
public health demands vaccinations	1850	NoArgument	Such extraordinary powers would lead to a draconian abuse of U.S. citizens’ lives, livelihood, privacy, freedom, liberty, health, wellbeing, among other countless, unintended consequences and lesser indignities.
public health demands vaccinations	1851	NoArgument	The rule changes are designed to divide and conquer groups, lovers, friends, and families, from husband and wife, brother and sister, to parents and guardians from their children.
public health demands vaccinations	1852	NoArgument	In short, the CDC will take full authorship of your life.
public health demands vaccinations	1853	NoArgument	From the NPRM, on privacy and surveillance, it states: “When an apprehension occurs, the individual is not free to leave or discontinue his/her discussion with an HHS/CDC public health or quarantine officer.” (NPRM, pg 10).
public health demands vaccinations	1854	NoArgument	“The Secretary’s authority to allow for the apprehension, examination, detention, and conditional release of individuals is limited to those communicable diseases specified in an Executive Order of the President.” (NPRM, pg 5).
public health demands vaccinations	1855	NoArgument	“Those communicable diseases, as of this NPRM include:.
public health demands vaccinations	1856	NoArgument	Since CDC will have total, unfettered power, it can add or delete (not likely, polio even when eradicated will be one vaccine away) any disease that fits their criteria.
public health demands vaccinations	1857	NoArgument	The process would be opaque or hidden by “national security” or emergency declarations.
public health demands vaccinations	1858	NoArgument	So if the rules changes are approved, by 2020 the Zika virus, measles, and seasonal flu will be added to the “quarantinable” list of diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1859	NoArgument	That’s just for starters.
public health demands vaccinations	1860	NoArgument	And those jabs will be given to the sick, elderly, dying, mentally impaired, babies, pregnant women, infants, children, teenagers, and adults of all races, creeds, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
public health demands vaccinations	1861	Argument_against	By owning such discretion, the CDC won’t have to test for the safety and efficacy of vaccines (on the list) anymore making them less safe.
public health demands vaccinations	1862	NoArgument	Talk about the Big Pharma jackpot of drug pushing, this NPRM is the meal ticket of the century.
public health demands vaccinations	1863	NoArgument	On federal orders, these beauties will be CDC nirvana:.
public health demands vaccinations	1864	NoArgument	“CDC conducts a mandatory reassessment 72 hours after the service of all Federal orders for quarantine, isolation, or conditional release.
public health demands vaccinations	1865	NoArgument	A medical review is part of the administrative appeals process whereby an individual under a Federal order may request a separate medical review of his/her case after the mandatory reassessment is complete.” (NPRM, pg 12).
public health demands vaccinations	1866	NoArgument	“Without the NPRM, HHS/CDC may issue Federal orders to restrict travel for persons infected or exposed to quarantinable communicable diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1867	NoArgument	However, this process is less transparent and efficient than allowing travel (i.e. issue travel permits to allow interstate travel to persons under Federal orders for diseases not currently identified under existing.
public health demands vaccinations	1868	NoArgument	Under current practice, HHS/CDC issues approximately one Federal order per year, most frequently for tuberculosis, which is a disease not included in the current.
public health demands vaccinations	1869	NoArgument	On “consent,” the HHS NPRM states: “Thus, in order to protect interstate travel from communicable disease threats, HHS/ CDC intends for this section to apply broadly to all circumstances where individuals may queue with other travelers because certain communicable diseases may be spread from person to person under such circumstances.” (NPRM, pg 16).
public health demands vaccinations	1870	NoArgument	Among other elements of power the CDC will gain, include checkpoints, fines, penalties and imprisonment, as well as other violations, real or imagine.
public health demands vaccinations	1871	NoArgument	"""The NPRM further authorizes expanded forms of public health monitoring, beyond an in-person visit by a public health officer, for individuals who are reasonably believed to be exposed to or infected with a quarantinable communicable disease and subject to a conditional release order."
public health demands vaccinations	1872	NoArgument	This would include monitoring through electronic and internet-based means, such as email and webcam application tools.” (NPRM, pg 3).
public health demands vaccinations	1873	NoArgument	Without blushing or trying to bury the blatant spying on Americans section in the fine print, the NPRM spits out its intent to own you both physically and electronically—your communications, personal and private information.
public health demands vaccinations	1874	NoArgument	Not only does HHS spell it out on page 3 of the NPRM, the word “internet” shows up on pages 11, 21, 22, 25, 80, 84, 85 and 87.
public health demands vaccinations	1875	NoArgument	No masking of what they intend to do there.
public health demands vaccinations	1876	NoArgument	So when one is quarantined in the near, near future, he or she might as well hand over their laptops, PCs, iPads, tablets, MS-Surface devices, , cell- and smartphones, flash-drives, external hard-drives, and their passwords for cloud storage docs, in effect the whole bowl of rice and main courses, too.
public health demands vaccinations	1877	NoArgument	Your rights, freedom, and liberty will be snuffed out for good.
public health demands vaccinations	1878	NoArgument	In the tens of thousands of words, dozens of references to existing case law, suits, laws on the books, and all that was put into this document over the past six to nine months, the word “Zika” cannot be found in the 88-page NPRM.
public health demands vaccinations	1879	NoArgument	People might say that the Zika virus is new, and that it hasn’t become the global threat until recently—President Obama brought it up this week at the G-20 Summit in China—but the more likely scenario is this:.
public health demands vaccinations	1880	NoArgument	The NPRM was designed not to alarm or trip the Klaxon siren, but to put out some logical (in their mind), innocuous quarantine rule changes that will meet the challenges of the rapidly developing world of the 21st century.
public health demands vaccinations	1881	NoArgument	The reality is the mainstream press has been gobbling up Zika news all year long, instilling fear in people, sacrificing bees and Florida tourism to the non-birth defect disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1882	Argument_for	If a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against (breakthrough infection), the disease is likely to be less virulent than in unvaccinated victims.
public health demands vaccinations	1883	NoArgument	And there won’t be a thing you can do about it, except take the vaccine, suffer the penalties or flee to country.
public health demands vaccinations	1884	NoArgument	From the ACLU’s review of state and federal laws pertaining to the Ebola outbreak, in its report, Fear, Politics and Ebola: How Quarantines Hurt the Fight Against Ebola and Violate the Constitution, (12-1-15), they lay out the mistakes and consequences (e.g., costs) that come with unnecessary quarantines.
public health demands vaccinations	1885	NoArgument	“The report correctly places responsibility for the ensuing panic squarely at the feet of our nation’s political leaders.
public health demands vaccinations	1886	NoArgument	Through sheer or willful ignorance, or simple political expediency, many governors enacted quarantine measures and other restrictive policies that not only misled the public, but threatened to actually undermine—rather than protect—public health both at home and in Ebola-affected countries.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1887	NoArgument	“There was little room in the political sphere or popular media for rational discussion of Ebola.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1888	NoArgument	“‘We don’t ask if hepatitis B will mutate to become airborne, so why do we ask it for Ebola?’.
public health demands vaccinations	1889	NoArgument	— Dr. Daniel Bausch, Tulane University”.
public health demands vaccinations	1890	NoArgument	“There is broad consensus in the scientific community that, because the risk of transmission from asymptomatic individuals infected with Ebola is so low, quarantines of asymptomatic individuals with potential Ebola exposure are unnecessary.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1891	NoArgument	“Ebola quarantines waste scarce public-health resources, and impose a multitude of costs.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1892	NoArgument	In other words, the ACLU saw the failure by the CDC to deal with the Ebola outbreak as an “overdue national reckoning.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1893	NoArgument	Your life, as you used to know it, will effectively be over.
public health demands vaccinations	1894	NoArgument	In review of this century’s failures by the CDC, from the runaway Autism epidemic and the fumbling of the Ebola crisis, to falsely promoting Zika as the next global threat to humanity, the CDC should be stripped of power, not granted more.
public health demands vaccinations	1895	NoArgument	James Grundvig is a contributor to AoA and the author of “Master Manipulator: The Explosive True Story of Fraud, Embezzlement and Government Betrayal at the CDC.”
public health demands vaccinations	1896	NoArgument	He lives and works in New York City, and has one teenage son on the spectrum.
public health demands vaccinations	1897	NoArgument	MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) - It is very unusual for Vice President Leni Robredo to remain quiet on issues of national concern - whether it be Duterte’s War on Drugs or the rehabilitation of Marawi City.
public health demands vaccinations	1898	NoArgument	So for Robredo to not issue a statement on the recent scandal involving the Aquino administration’s approval to vaccinate some 700,000 school kids with a new Dengue vaccine puzzles both supporters and critics of the VP.
public health demands vaccinations	1899	Argument_against	We now know that the Dengue vaccine — as admitted by the manufacturer — has the potential of causing more serious Dengue disease among those who had not had a previous Dengue infection.
public health demands vaccinations	1900	NoArgument	The Aquino administration approved the Dengue vaccination even prior to the approval/recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO).
public health demands vaccinations	1901	NoArgument	The Adobo Chronicles caught up with Robredo on as bus she was in, bound for her hometown of Naga City, and we asked her why she hasn’t said a word about the big scandal.
public health demands vaccinations	1902	NoArgument	”Well, I choose which important issues to comment on,” the VP said.
public health demands vaccinations	1903	NoArgument	“It would be a waste of my time to issue a statement on a trivial thing like dried fish.”.
public health demands vaccinations	1904	NoArgument	Robredo thought Dengue was the same as the dried fish, Danggit.
public health demands vaccinations	1905	Argument_for	Vaccines can save children's lives.
public health demands vaccinations	1906	Argument_for	The American Academy of Pediatrics states that most childhood vaccines are 90%-99% effective in preventing disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1907	Argument_against	Vaccines can cause serious and sometimes fatal side effects.
public health demands vaccinations	1908	Argument_against	"Aluminum is used in some vaccines and excess aluminum in human bodies can cause neurological harm. (source: Robert W. Sears, ""Vaccine FAQS: Aluminum Information from The Vaccine Book,"" www.askdrsears.com (accessed June 11, 2014) )"
public health demands vaccinations	1909	Argument_against	"Formaldehyde, also found in some vaccines, is a carcinogen, and, according to VaxTruth.org, exposure can cause side effects such as cardiac impairment, central nervous system depression, ""changes in higher cognitive functions,"" coma, convulsions, and death. (source: VaxTruth, ""Vaccine Ingredients – A Comprehensive Guide,"" www.vaxtruth.org, Aug. 15, 2011)"
public health demands vaccinations	1910	Argument_against	Mandatory vaccines infringe upon constitutionally protected religious freedoms.
public health demands vaccinations	1911	Argument_against	Vaccines can contain ingredients some people consider immoral or otherwise objectionable.
public health demands vaccinations	1912	Argument_against	Some vaccines for DTaP, Hep A, RV, Hib, HPV, IPV, flu, MMR, and chicken pox are made using animal products like chicken eggs, bovine casein, insect cells, Cocker Spaniel cells, pig gelatin, and cells from African Green monkeys, making those vaccines conflict with some vegetarian and vegan philosophies.
public health demands vaccinations	1913	Argument_against	Others consider it problematic that some vaccines are produced using human albumin, a blood plasma protein.
public health demands vaccinations	1914	Argument_against	 The primary goal of pharmaceutical companies is to sell drugs and make a profit so they should not be trusted to make and regulate safe vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1915	Argument_against	Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction).
public health demands vaccinations	1916	Argument_for	Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1917	Argument_for	Widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world.
public health demands vaccinations	1918	Argument_for	Dendritic cell vaccines have shown some positive preliminary results for treating brain tumors and are also tested in malignant melanoma.
public health demands vaccinations	1919	Argument_for	vaccines are a good thing yes because vaccines can eradicate viruses 
public health demands vaccinations	1920	Argument_for	Lets say you could refuse vaccinations due to religion and allergies because that's still only 9.5% of the US and is still enough to get everyone else vaccinated so we can eradicate many viruses.
public health demands vaccinations	1921	Argument_for	A non-vaccinated person may infect babies that haven't yet been scheduled to receive their vaccines.
public health demands vaccinations	1922	Argument_for	A non-vaccinated person may also infect the small percentage of kids for whom their immunizations don't work, as immunizations aren't 100 percent effective
public health demands vaccinations	1923	Argument_for	Delaying a vaccine just means there's that much longer a window for an unimmunized child to get sick.
public health demands vaccinations	1924	Argument_for	Most of the side effects of vaccines are mild compared to the illnesses they prevent. 
public health demands vaccinations	1925	Argument_for	Vaccines work because vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year (source: Twitter)
public health demands vaccinations	1926	Argument_for	Vaccination is good because it protects herd immunity
public health demands vaccinations	1927	Argument_for	Most parents in Victorian times lost children regularly to preventable illnesses and vaccines can solve this problem 
public health demands vaccinations	1928	Argument_against	People Are Getting Sicker after a vaccine
public health demands vaccinations	1929	Argument_for	Vaccines are safe and effective, not because pharmaceutical companies say it’s so or because the CDC has proclaimed it, but because thousands of dedicated researchers the world over have spent decades checking to make sure that they are
public health demands vaccinations	1930	Argument_for	According to supporters, vaccination has been responsible for dramatic reductions in death and illness from infectious disease and vaccination continues to be a vital measure to prevent a resurgence of disease.
public health demands vaccinations	1931	Argument_for	Vaccination has been hailed as one of the greatest contributions of medicine to human health, dramatically reducing the incidence of infectious diseases.
public health demands vaccinations	1932	Argument_for	Vaccines are safe because they are rigorously tested on thousands of people in progressively larger clinical trials which are monitored for safety.
public health demands vaccinations	1933	Argument_for	Vaccines protect against diseases that can harm your child
public health demands vaccinations	1934	Argument_for	The development of effective vaccines has led to a huge decrease in childhood deaths.

white Helmets provide essential services	2149	NoArgument	On the contrary, it is obvious that the White Helmets do receive direct funding from the UK, the U.S, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Qatar and New Zealand according to their regularly updated Wikipedia page .

white Helmets provide essential services	2158	NoArgument	This was announced on the 26th April, days after Saleh’s attendance at the McCain Institute in Arizona.
white Helmets provide essential services	2159	Argument_against	If Hanna is correct, the White Helmets, an alleged NGO, is accepting contracts from Qatar and Turkey to operate inside Syria, two of the countries most implicated in the incubation and financing of the extremist and terrorist factions affiliated to the White Helmets, namely Al Qaeda and offshoots, armed groups that are responsible for the seven year bloodshed inside Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2160	Argument_against	The hostile-state-funded White Helmets are striking deals with terrorist producing states to work inside Syria in terrorist controlled regions, obviously without the knowledge or approval of the internationally recognised Syrian government in Damascus.

white Helmets provide essential services	2169	NoArgument	It is perhaps time that we, the public, took ownership of the White Helmets and demanded answers from this organisation that has been so skillfully protected by our governments, their aligned media PR agencies and group-think tanks.
white Helmets provide essential services	2170	NoArgument	Whatever the outcome, it is increasingly clear that the U.S funding freeze for the White Helmets may well prove to be another in a long line of Trump administration myths that included the withdrawl from an illegal occupation of 30% of Syrian territory statement which was made just prior to the latest White Helmet “chemical attack” production in Douma, Eastern Ghouta which led to the unlawful strikes against Syria by the tripartite alliance of U.S, UK and France with Israel in a pre-strike surveillance role.

white Helmets provide essential services	2219	NoArgument	They are provided with food, housing, cleaning materials, water and electricity by the Syrian government and a number of Syrian NGOs.
white Helmets provide essential services	2220	NoArgument	When I was in Eastern Ghouta during the last moments of final liberation, particularly for Jaish Al Islam occupied Douma, I witnessed the exodus of civilians from their incarceration by Western financed extremist groups of all denominations.
white Helmets provide essential services	2221	NoArgument	These exhausted, traumatised citizens of the eastern suburbs and countryside of Damascus exited via the Syrian government and Russian protected Humanitarian corridors that enabled them to escape despite harrowing tales of being shelled and sniped by terrorist factions, infuriated by their departure.
white Helmets provide essential services	2222	NoArgument	I was able to interview a number of these people who had fled the unbelievable deprivation and brutality of these extremist “regimes” that were imposed upon them by the Syrian regime-change-war proponents in the West.
white Helmets provide essential services	2223	NoArgument	Their testimonies lay waste to the myths of these mercenaries and armed militia groups being freedom bringers or champions of “Democracy”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2224	NoArgument	They detail a life of fear, poverty, homelessness and hunger beyond the realms of understanding for many in the West who have been duped into believing the “moderate” myths promulgated by state media outlets in the UK, EU and US – nothing more than a glorified protection racket for the criminal NATO member state foreign policy targeting Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2225	NoArgument	Corporate media will naturally throw its collective hands up in horror at the Pandora’s box of secrets that is opened by the voices of these Syrian people who are finally able to speak freely without fear of retribution from the ruling extremist mafia gangs that held them hostage for 6 years in Eastern Ghouta.
white Helmets provide essential services	2226	NoArgument	These corporate media stenographers will claim these Syrians only speak out of fear of Syrian Government punishment if they were to express views that were against their government.
white Helmets provide essential services	2227	NoArgument	The group-Think Tanks will also denigrate these Syrian civilians, dismissing their words as “carefully selected” condemnation of the atrocities committed by the extremist groups those Atlanticist institutions have promoted and supported throughout the 7 year proxy war.
white Helmets provide essential services	2228	NoArgument	Will these “experts” and “analysts” have the moral decreptitude to condemn all civilian testimony from within the 85% of inhabited Syrian territory under Syrian government protection as scripted by Syrian government officials?
white Helmets provide essential services	2229	NoArgument	Testimony is always open to interpretation and requires back-up investigations and empirical evidence but to dismiss this civilian testimony outright is an insult to these people who have endured appalling cruelty and miserable conditions for so many years.
white Helmets provide essential services	2230	NoArgument	They have a right to speak, they have a right to be heard and their testimony should be taken into consideration when evaluating the events inside Syria that have been woefully misrepresented by the Western media bias in favour of a regime change narrative serving the neocon war hawks in Washington, London and Paris.
white Helmets provide essential services	2231	NoArgument	How many “anonymous” sources have western media cited to support their claims against the Syrian government, Syrian Arab Army and allies?
white Helmets provide essential services	2232	NoArgument	How many questionable, terrorist affiliated witnesses and western financed shadow state organisations do these media outlets rely upon to provide the narratives that fit into their narrow framework?
white Helmets provide essential services	2233	NoArgument	How many of these western media sideline hecklers have actually been to Syria and confronted these Syrian people with their ‘suspicions’ that they are lying or are speaking under duress?
white Helmets provide essential services	2234	NoArgument	The interviews I conducted and have uploaded to my YouTube channel are on the whole unedited.
white Helmets provide essential services	2235	NoArgument	They are the unadulterated accounts of life under Jaish Al Islam rule or an assortment of other groups such as Failaq Al Rahman, Ahrar Al Sham, Nusra Front (Al Qaeda).
white Helmets provide essential services	2236	NoArgument	They also contain very clear accusations levied at the NATO-member-state financed and promoted White Helmets – accusations that echo those made by Syrian civilians liberated from a Nusra Front dominated occupation of the Eastern districts of Aleppo in December 2016.
white Helmets provide essential services	2237	NoArgument	I was also present in Syria during that liberation.
white Helmets provide essential services	2238	NoArgument	In any court of law, these voices would be heard.
white Helmets provide essential services	2239	NoArgument	Their evidence would be taken into account and examined with the seriousness their accusations merit.
white Helmets provide essential services	2240	NoArgument	However, according to western media, they should be buried, scoffed at, marginalised.
white Helmets provide essential services	2241	NoArgument	I leave it to a discerning public to make up their own minds.
white Helmets provide essential services	2242	NoArgument	Terrorists poisoned civilians, left children to die of starvation in basements.
white Helmets provide essential services	2243	NoArgument	I interviewed this courageous mother in Harjallah IDP centre in April 2018 after the final liberation of #Douma and Eastern Ghouta.
white Helmets provide essential services	2244	NoArgument	Her name is Sabah Al Mushref.
white Helmets provide essential services	2245	NoArgument	She spoke to me for some time and I will upload the videos and her testimony bit by bit as it is both harrowing and powerful.
white Helmets provide essential services	2246	NoArgument	She spoke without prompting.
white Helmets provide essential services	2247	NoArgument	We had no government officials with us during the interview.
white Helmets provide essential services	2248	NoArgument	We were allowed to ask any questions we needed to without restrictions.
white Helmets provide essential services	2249	NoArgument	As I have mentioned, corporate media “journalists” love to discredit these testimonies as being ‘influenced’ by the Syrian government but I challenge those armchair “experts” to come to Syria and to tell Sabah she is not telling the truth.
white Helmets provide essential services	2250	NoArgument	Have these people not suffered enough at the hands of the terrorist groups that the same corporate media in the West describe as “freedom and democracy rebels”?
white Helmets provide essential services	2251	NoArgument	These women have escaped a fate that was ‘worth than death’ for them.
white Helmets provide essential services	2252	NoArgument	Many of these civilians described the multiple “deaths” they experienced living in extremist-occupied Eastern Ghouta.
white Helmets provide essential services	2253	NoArgument	These women were still exhausted and sick but they are safe and life can begin again without the ghosts of death, child abduction, organ theft and torture that haunt them.
white Helmets provide essential services	2254	NoArgument	This lady clung to her child and told me she had been so frightened for her safety, so many had been “stolen” for organ theft, some just disappeared and were never heard of again.
white Helmets provide essential services	2255	NoArgument	I will be bringing you more from this Syrian heroine as I receive updated translation of her testimony she represents all who have suffered under Western backed terrorist rule and who have been liberated by the Syrian Arab Army and their allies the future is not easy, there is another war to be fought as many Syrians told me, “The war of forgiveness” – but when we see the spirit, the courage of these women and many of the most vulnerable of Syrian society who have endured a life of deprivation, fear and oppression, yet escaped intact and determined to rebuild, to restore and to lead their lives in a Syria free from terrorismwe know that for all of us, the battle is one for justice and freedom for all honourable, true human beings.
white Helmets provide essential services	2256	Argument_against	White Helmets are embedded with terrorist groups.
white Helmets provide essential services	2257	NoArgument	One of many, many interviews with civilians from Eastern Ghouta, including medical staff and doctors at the Medical Point in Douma.

white Helmets provide essential services	2355	NoArgument	While thousands of humanitarian organisations around the world are struggling fiercely with diminishing support from governments and the public, one has achieved a surprising amount of support from Western governments in a surprisingly short period of time and gained a surprising attention from mainstream media and ditto political elites: The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets.
white Helmets provide essential services	2356	NoArgument	Their name of course makes you think of the UN’s Blue Helmet and white is the colour of those who should be protected in harm’s way – and the colour of innocence.
white Helmets provide essential services	2357	NoArgument	However, for many years there has been an Argentinian relief organisation with the same name.
white Helmets provide essential services	2358	Argument_for	The SCD or White Helmets counts nearly 3.000 rescue workers who operate in very dangerous areas in rebel-held territories in Syria and claims that it has, in three years, rescued about 70.000 lives according to its Twitter account (or 65 per day).
white Helmets provide essential services	2359	NoArgument	Contrary to what you might think, it isn’t a Syrian organisation because Syria has its own organisation, incidentally also called Syria Civil Defence, which was established in 1953 and is registered with ICDO, the International Civil Defence Organisation , since 1972.
white Helmets provide essential services	2360	NoArgument	The White Helmets seems to have an annual budget of US$ 30 million and has raised a total support of well over US$ 100 million.
white Helmets provide essential services	2361	NoArgument	And it seems that they operate exclusively in war zones in which the fighting against the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Army takes place, i.e. in ‘liberated’ areas where hundreds of groups and some 80 countries, mainly NATO members, Gulf states and Saudi-Arabia, operate.
white Helmets provide essential services	2362	NoArgument	On the White Helmets’ briefing page it is stated that “funding for their humanitarian relief work is received from the aid budgets of Japan, Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2363	NoArgument	Here is how the Foreign Ministry in Copenhagen explains the roughly US$ 9 million to the White helmets from Denmark, a country that bombs in both Iraq and Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2364	NoArgument	Other civil society and humanitarian organisations inside Syria have not been so fortunate.
white Helmets provide essential services	2365	NoArgument	You’ve probably not heard that much about the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and its work ?
white Helmets provide essential services	2366	NoArgument	How much/little support have they received from Western humanitarian-concerned governments?
white Helmets provide essential services	2367	NoArgument	And in general, civil society organisations in Syria – women, peace, human rights, culture, etc. – have received nothing like US$ 100 million in a few years and no one has such a flashy media appearance as the White Helmets.
white Helmets provide essential services	2368	NoArgument	Photo from the White Helmets’ homepage.
white Helmets provide essential services	2369	NoArgument	The White Helmets was started in 2013 by James Le Mesurier who seems to have tried a little of everything everywhere, including the grey zones of special forces and intelligence in virtually all NATO wars, Yugoslavia in particular.
white Helmets provide essential services	2370	NoArgument	He later set up a foundation in Holland to gather the funds.
white Helmets provide essential services	2371	NoArgument	Here is a recent account by Scott Ritter , former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and weapons inspector in Iraq with tremendous knowledge of things Middle East:.
white Helmets provide essential services	2372	NoArgument	“ The organizational underpinnings of the White Helmets can be sourced to a March 2013 meeting in Istanbul between a retired British military officer, James Le Mesurier—who had experience in the murky world of private security companies and the shadowy confluence between national security and intelligence operations and international organizations—and representatives of the Syrian National Council (SNC) and the Qatari Red Crescent Society.
white Helmets provide essential services	2373	NoArgument	Earlier that month, the SNC was given Syria’s seat in the Arab League at a meeting of the league held in Qatar.
white Helmets provide essential services	2374	NoArgument	At that meeting, the SNC assumed Syria’s seat, and the Arab League authorized member states to actively provide support, including arms and ammunition, to the Syrian rebels.
white Helmets provide essential services	2375	NoArgument	The Qataris, working through the SNC, helped assemble for Le Mesurier $300,000 in seed money from Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom for a seven-day course designed to train and equip a 25-person rescue team, recruited by the SNC, for duty in so-called “liberated areas” of Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2376	NoArgument	The SNC made available a pair of Syrian activists—Raed Saleh and Farouq Habib—to assist Le Mesurier in this work.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2377	NoArgument	The group is – as will be seen below – treated as uncontroversial in virtually all Western mainstream media.
white Helmets provide essential services	2378	NoArgument	However, there is enough material with documentation to merit caution.
white Helmets provide essential services	2379	Argument_against	If you read media reports about the White Helmets and do not see the author mention that this group’s real identity is disputed and functions controversial you can be sure that you are wasting your time with somebody who is politically incredibly naive, or gullible; someone who has not done his or her research or is knowingly part of a deceptive effort serving a one-sided political agenda.
white Helmets provide essential services	2380	NoArgument	The White Helmets definitely is an controversial NGO – at the same time as it is (made) difficult to understand clearly what it really is.
white Helmets provide essential services	2381	NoArgument	And until the whole picture has been developed, anyone ought to be cautious with taking information about them at face value.
white Helmets provide essential services	2382	NoArgument	So much must be clear given the links below.

white Helmets provide essential services	2384	Argument_for	Some observers draw the conclusion that the White Helmets are purely good guys rescuing lots of people, children in particular.
white Helmets provide essential services	2385	Argument_against	The opposite advocacy claims that, all told, White helmets are part of the terrorist groups, serve Western governments with intelligence and that their backers run political propaganda in their name and that they are simply executioners – murderers with a human face.
white Helmets provide essential services	2386	NoArgument	But does it have to be either/or?
white Helmets provide essential services	2387	NoArgument	An alternative hypothesis could be that the White Helmets is a dual-purpose organisation.
white Helmets provide essential services	2388	Argument_for	They claim to be ordinary Syrian volunteers who came together around the idea of saving lives and are truly altruistic “bakers, tailors, engineers, pharmacists, painters, carpenters, students and many more, the White Helmets are volunteers from all walks of life.”
white Helmets provide essential services	2389	NoArgument	It could well be that some of them actually are, even a majority.
white Helmets provide essential services	2390	Argument_against	That doesn’t preclude that other elements – not the least those operating outside Syria such as foundations, PR and marketing firms, change organisations, NATO government and NGOs are in it with less noble, war-promoting purposes.

white Helmets provide essential services	2430	NoArgument	Hanrahan quotes ’s campaign director, former State Department official John Tye, “that  shows 54,000 members in Syria in a population of 23 million – which means that even if every  member supported a no-fly zone, this would still mean that only one of every 426 Syrians had “voted” for one.

white Helmets provide essential services	2470	NoArgument	Here are some of the reasons – numbers not indicative of priority:.
white Helmets provide essential services	2471	Argument_against	1: White Helmets have huge funding by NATO/EU countries which are militarily involved.
white Helmets provide essential services	2472	Argument_against	2: A degree of political lobbying – a very specific explanation of the conflict and how it started which points to a no-fly zone, weaponization of human rights issues and speaks strongly against the Syrian government and Russia and very critically of the UN – that is extremely unusual for the White Helmets, a purely humanitarian organisation.
white Helmets provide essential services	2473	Argument_against	3: White helmets have incredibly advanced public relation in terms of very professional websites, videos and PR strategy dropping the right stories and images at the right time – quite unique for a group of “bakers, tailors and students” etc. “Omram rescued from a Russian airstrike” – From the White Helmets’ homepage.
white Helmets provide essential services	2474	Argument_against	4: White helmets use too professional wordings and images, too much playing to (exploitation of) emotions, too catchy smart formulations again and again; in short, lacking every sense of genuine local quality.
white Helmets provide essential services	2475	NoArgument	Too many children – and cats – in the images speaking to an audience with little politically consciousness but surely a good heart.
white Helmets provide essential services	2476	NoArgument	In short, populist marketing also in the sense of conveying the message: Look how good we are and how evil everybody else are.
white Helmets provide essential services	2477	Argument_against	5: Guilt by association: If the White Helmets is a 100% humanitarian first responder organisation it must be extremely naive in ignoring that its integrity, credibility and noble purposes is put at risk with the specific network of organisations and governments that it has chosen to seek support from.
white Helmets provide essential services	2478	Argument_against	6: Substance versus public relation: how does the white helmets, a humanitarian organisation, justify that millions of dollars are spent on self-promoting public relation rather than on saving more lives in such a horrific war?
white Helmets provide essential services	2479	Argument_against	How does the white helmets justify taking so many photos and shoot films of its own work in the midst of massacres and bombing raids?
white Helmets provide essential services	2480	Argument_against	7: It’s very difficult to discern who actually manages the White Helmets in general and in terms of day-to-day operations.
white Helmets provide essential services	2481	NoArgument	One looks in vain for something like an organisational chart secretary-general, board, executive director (although one is mentioned, Raed Saleh, whom the US has on one occasion actually denied entry into the US).
white Helmets provide essential services	2482	Argument_against	8: How come that such an innovative organisation seems to have been started in circles that have to do with oil interests, British intelligence, mercenary/military operations and interventionist/bombing countries?
white Helmets provide essential services	2483	NoArgument	9: How come it works only in rebel/terrorist/liberated areas?
white Helmets provide essential services	2484	NoArgument	Could it do that without co-operation or co-ordination with some of these groups?
white Helmets provide essential services	2485	Argument_for	It has been stated by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation that White helmets's vision is to operate also on government-controlled territory and later be a leader in re-building a new democratic post-war Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2486	NoArgument	However, why should the sovereign state of Syria’s legitimate government accept a foreign-based and -financed civil defence territory there when it has had its own since 1953?
white Helmets provide essential services	2487	NoArgument	Perhaps we should not be that surprised?
white Helmets provide essential services	2488	NoArgument	Should we be surprised that humanitarian workers are involved in “something else” and are not exclusively devoted to doing no harm and doing good for humanity?
white Helmets provide essential services	2489	NoArgument	Not really.
white Helmets provide essential services	2490	NoArgument	I’ve met that sort of people and organisations during the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, among other places at the US Embassy in Zagreb where the humanitarian section people, most likely CIA operatives, after some talk with me about helping the people switched to talk about how good it would be if president Milosevic was killed.

white Helmets provide essential services	2500	NoArgument	When the buildings are hit unknown to the Syrians and the Russians, these chemicals are hit.

white Helmets provide essential services	2539	Argument_against	A pro-government media activist, Penelope Stafyla , has released a series of photos reportedly showing a media studio of the White Helmets, which produces “evidence of Assad regime war crimes” in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the Syrian capital of Damascus.
white Helmets provide essential services	2540	NoArgument	These photos are especially interesting amid circulating reports about a new “chemical attack” by the “Assad reg... .
white Helmets provide essential services	2541	NoArgument	The new “chemical attack” narrative came amid large gains by government forces against militants groups in the area and allegedly injured over 30 people.
white Helmets provide essential services	2542	NoArgument	For example, Turkey’s Anadolu Agency reported the alleged incident citing a report by the White Helmets ( source ):.
white Helmets provide essential services	2543	NoArgument	At least 30 people were treated for breathing difficulties after a regime chlorine gas attack in the Damascus suburb of Eastern Ghouta, according to a Syrian civil defense agency on Tuesday.

white Helmets provide essential services	2551	NoArgument	As the Syrian government marches forward with the liberation of the southwestern front, the United States, Europe, Israel, and Jordan are coming to the humanitarian rescue .
white Helmets provide essential services	2552	NoArgument	But they aren’t rescuing civilians from terrorists or even from being caught in the crossfire.
white Helmets provide essential services	2553	NoArgument	Instead, these countries have identified a group of “exceptional refugees” whose lives matter much more than those of the civilians the West has wantonly slaughtered for the last seven years.
white Helmets provide essential services	2554	NoArgument	Although refusing to open its borders, Israel (apparently the only country in the world that is allowed to maintain borders) has allowed members of the al-Nusra Front propaganda wing known as the White Helmets to access Israeli territory on their way to resettlement in Britain, Canada, and Germany according to Jordanian officials.
white Helmets provide essential services	2555	NoArgument	Jordan was also part of the Caravan of Evil.
white Helmets provide essential services	2556	NoArgument	All in all, around 800 White Helmets were evacuated from Syrian territory.
white Helmets provide essential services	2557	NoArgument	As Zero Hedge reported , the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed Israel’s spearheading the move at the request of the United States and European governments.
white Helmets provide essential services	2558	NoArgument	The dead of night operation comes a week after reports first surfaced that serious discussions were held on the matter during the July 11-12 NATO summit in Brussels.
white Helmets provide essential services	2559	NoArgument	The IDF official twitter account posted the following statement : “Following an Israeli Government directive and at the request of the United States and additional European countries, the IDF recently completed a humanitarian effort to rescue members of a Syrian civil organization and their families.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2560	Argument_for	The IDF further called the effort “an exceptional humanitarian gesture” and additionally confirmed that the White Helmets were transferred “through Israel”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2561	Argument_against	US officials including the State Department spokesperson have this summer made it a key talking point to warn of White Helmets being in “imminent danger” throughout Syria and face the threat of assassination especially in the country’s southwest, as pro-government forces have now nearly completed their successful campaign to take back all of Daraa and Quneitra provinces.
white Helmets provide essential services	2562	NoArgument	The transfer began at around 9:30pm local time with a large convoy of buses exiting a frontier area on the Golan Heights toward Israel.
white Helmets provide essential services	2563	NoArgument	According to a Bild report, the convoy reached the Jordanian border at 5 a.m. and had some level of assistance from the United Nations.
white Helmets provide essential services	2564	NoArgument	The Jerusalem Post notes that though the Jordanian government early on acknowledged it would initially host the displaced group, Israel had to keep its role hidden throughout the transfer.
white Helmets provide essential services	2565	NoArgument	“Neither the AP report nor the Jordanian government statement mention Israel.
white Helmets provide essential services	2566	NoArgument	This points to the fact that Israel’s role was considered controversial and that the method of the evacuation had to be kept under wraps until it was complete,” according to the Jerusalem Post report .
white Helmets provide essential services	2567	NoArgument	Meanwhile a number of journalists and analysts asked the obvious million dollar question: “Why evacuation specifically for just this group and its families?” Why not other civilians?”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2568	Argument_for	The answer is because the White Helmets are exceptional.
white Helmets provide essential services	2569	Argument_against	White helmets are not mere civilians but well-rehearsed actors who have played such a vital role in the propaganda against the secular Syrian government.
white Helmets provide essential services	2570	Argument_against	White helmets are, without a doubt, the propaganda wing of al Nusra Front, evidence of which I have seen in person when I traveled to East Aleppo after the liberation of that city from the hands of Western-backed terrorists and as Vanessa Beeley and others have documented ad nauseum in the alternative media.
white Helmets provide essential services	2571	NoArgument	See Vanessa Beeley’s article “ SYRIA: The White Helmet Exodus Managed by ‘Regime-Change’ Coalition.
white Helmets provide essential services	2572	NoArgument	With that being said, there are a number of questions that should be asked as the White Helmets head to Europe and Canada though tellingly not to the United States.
white Helmets provide essential services	2573	Argument_against	Perhaps the reason for the banishment of White Helmets terrorists from American soil is because the Trump administration would prefer not to have another false flag terror attack in the United States during 45’s term in office or perhaps they simply are necessary to manufacture one.
white Helmets provide essential services	2574	NoArgument	Regardless, the terrorists that are praised so lavishly by the United States government and mainstream corporate media are persona non grata in the country that pays many of the bills.
white Helmets provide essential services	2575	NoArgument	So the first question would be, as Vanessa Beeley asked on Twitter 1.)
white Helmets provide essential services	2576	NoArgument	Who actually verified that all 800 people being evacuated from Syria to Europe and North America are actually White Helmets?
white Helmets provide essential services	2577	NoArgument	Couldn’t they be members of some other terrorist organization?
white Helmets provide essential services	2578	NoArgument	How have they been vetted in such a short period of time?
white Helmets provide essential services	2579	Argument_against	Why exactly does it matter if they are White Helmets or members of another terrorist organization since the White Helmets have been proven to have taken part in terrorist attacks, executions, and beheadings?
white Helmets provide essential services	2580	NoArgument	To quote the lizard queen Hillary Clinton herself, “What difference does it make?” A radical jihadist that beheads captive people because of their religion or their support for their government is a terrorist.
white Helmets provide essential services	2581	NoArgument	It doesn’t really matter if he belongs to group A or group B does it?
white Helmets provide essential services	2582	NoArgument	Another question posed on twitter by Nikita Thierry is 3.)
white Helmets provide essential services	2583	NoArgument	Why do the White Helmets have to evacuate ahead of the Syrian military’s liberation?
white Helmets provide essential services	2584	NoArgument	The Syrian Red Crescent volunteers have never had to do so.
white Helmets provide essential services	2585	NoArgument	The REAL Syrian Civil Defense has never had to evacuate (though they have been attacked, robbed, and killed by America’s terrorists).
white Helmets provide essential services	2586	Argument_against	If the White Helmets were truly selfless humanitarians, why must they evacuate ahead of every government liberation?
white Helmets provide essential services	2587	NoArgument	Why wouldn’t they stay to aid the civilians still in the area?
white Helmets provide essential services	2588	NoArgument	Why do they only operate in terrorist held areas?
white Helmets provide essential services	2589	NoArgument	And lastly, though I would suggest most importantly, 4.)
white Helmets provide essential services	2590	NoArgument	Is the West really evacuating its own intelligence agents and intelligence assets?
white Helmets provide essential services	2591	NoArgument	Syrian MP and Director of the Chamber of Commerce certainly seems to believe so.
white Helmets provide essential services	2592	NoArgument	So does Ziad Fadel of Syrian Perspective whose information and sources have been consistently reliable throughout the seven years of this war.
white Helmets provide essential services	2593	NoArgument	Is Amazon About to Shock Bitcoin Investors?
white Helmets provide essential services	2594	NoArgument	The true reason, [for the evacuation] I am told by my sources, is that there were 2,200 special ops and intelligence officers who were trapped at the border with the White Helmets and who were under threat of being captured or killed by the Syrian Army.
white Helmets provide essential services	2595	NoArgument	Instead, only 400 or less White Helmets were provided with seats on the Zionist helicopters.
white Helmets provide essential services	2596	NoArgument	Another 600 and their families remain trapped at the border where they will either be killed by ISIS nearby or by our troops.
white Helmets provide essential services	2597	NoArgument	The scene, I am told, was like the last day of the Vietnam evacuation in April of 1975 with people struggling to get on the helicopters.
white Helmets provide essential services	2598	NoArgument	Of the 2,200 foreign spies and the special ops rodents, 1100 were from Gulf States like Qatar, Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.
white Helmets provide essential services	2599	NoArgument	They are now in Amman awaiting repatriation.
white Helmets provide essential services	2600	Argument_against	Indeed, even when one ignores the fact that the White Helmets were created by a French mercenary and funded by the US and UK, the group’s track record shows a level of anticipation and delivery of propaganda videos and recordings of “incidents” coinciding with the interests of Western governments that is so uncanny that one could scarcely believe that the group was working in any way in an independent fashion.
white Helmets provide essential services	2601	Argument_against	No organization working to demonize the Syrian government and capitalize on political events on an independent basis would ever have such a string of luck and “coincidences” as the White Helmets have had without prior consultation and direct communication with intelligence agencies.
white Helmets provide essential services	2602	NoArgument	But the questions, important as they are, have been made irrelevant.
white Helmets provide essential services	2603	NoArgument	Either way, al-Qaeda is heading to Europe and North America and, given the recent intentional demographic shifts in those populations, it will find fertile ground in which to grow until the time it is called upon again to reshape the Western world with false flag or state sponsored terror.

white Helmets provide essential services	2611	NoArgument	Who Is James Le Mesurier? - The Former British Army Officer Who Founded The White Helmets - American Herald Tribune.
white Helmets provide essential services	2612	NoArgument	Who is James Le Mesurier, the former British army officer and military contractor who founded the White Helmets , the civil defence organisation which operates exclusively in opposition-held parts of Syria?
white Helmets provide essential services	2613	NoArgument	It is a question more and more people are asking as their role and function comes under increasing scrutiny.
white Helmets provide essential services	2614	NoArgument	Le Mesurier carries about him the inescapable whiff of Britain’s malign legacy and history of dirty wars, waged in Kenya, Aden, Ireland, Iraq, Libya, in other words wherever London’s blood-soaked imperialist foot has tread around the world.
white Helmets provide essential services	2615	NoArgument	A product of Britain’s prestigious Royal Military Academy of officer training at Sandhurst, he served in various UK military/NATO military deployments over the past three decades, specifically Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Lebanon.
white Helmets provide essential services	2616	NoArgument	In a short bio describing Le Mesurier’s work with the White Helmets, we are informed, “In addition to the White Helmets in Syria, Mayday is active in Mogadishu, developing the city's emergency services network, and exploring the development of similar community-based resilience initiatives in other fragile and failing states (my emphasis).”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2617	NoArgument	The question of why a given state becomes fragile and failing is of course neither asked nor explored, for doing so would dredge up the subject of imperialism, which for Western ideologues such as Mr Le Mesurier would be akin to a vampire being exposed to daylight.
white Helmets provide essential services	2618	NoArgument	In a wide ranging 2016 article , former US marine and UN weapons inspector, Scott Ritter, provides a forensic account of Le Mesurier’s background, including the time he spent in and around the murky world of private military contractors, who exist in the cracks of Western military deployments, able to operate beyond the inconvenient glare of public scrutiny and accountability.
white Helmets provide essential services	2619	NoArgument	“the organizational underpinnings of the White Helmets can be sourced to a March 2013 meeting in Istanbul between a retired British military officer, James Le Mesurier—who had experience in the murky world of private security companies and the shadowy confluence between national security and intelligence operations and international organizations—and representatives of the Syrian National Council (SNC) and the Qatari Red Crescent Society.
white Helmets provide essential services	2620	NoArgument	Earlier that month, the SNC was given Syria’s seat in the Arab League at a meeting of the league held in Qatar.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2621	NoArgument	So here we have a civil defence organisation being established in Syria by an ex-British army officer, a man with a background in the shadowy world of private security, in conjunction with a Syrian opposition group in exile.
white Helmets provide essential services	2622	Argument_against	This civil defence organization, the White Helmets , receives funding from an array of states with a clear agenda of regime change in Syria , evidenced in the material, financial and political support they have given various armed opposition groups involved in the conflict.
white Helmets provide essential services	2623	NoArgument	In a 2015 speech Le Mesurier provides a précis of the roots of the conflict in Syria, starting with in 2011 a “volunteer uprising against the ruthless dictator, Bashar al-Assad,” before going on the assert that in 2012 the Syrian state turned its weapons on its “own people.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2624	NoArgument	Glaringly absent from this Manichean narrative is the fact that by 2012 various Salafi-jihadi groups, their ranks filled by thousands of extremists from outwith Syria, were rampaging across the country slaughtering and raping and terrorizing the very “own people” the Syrian army and its allies have been fighting to protect, save and liberate from the clutches of this latter day Khmer Rouge.
white Helmets provide essential services	2625	NoArgument	And lest anyone has forgotten, the Syrian Arab Army is indistinguishable from the Syrian people, considering that its soldiers are drawn from the non-sectarian and multi-religious mosaic that makes up Syrian society.
white Helmets provide essential services	2626	Argument_against	Returning to Scott Ritter: “In this day of social media, it didn’t take long for photographs and video clips of known White Helmet members, in their distinctive uniform, openly celebrating with Al Nusra fighters in the aftermath of Syrian government defeats, and even carrying weapons, something their status as neutral first responders strictly prohibits.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2627	Argument_against	From the White Helmets’ own website , the lack of neutrality Ritter asserts is unambiguously expressed with the statement posted on its front page by Raed Saleh, the operational head of the organisation and himself a figure of some controversy: “the UN Security Council must follow on its demand to stop the barrel bombs, by introducing a ‘no-fly zone’ if necessary.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2628	NoArgument	The barrel bombs referred to by Saleh, and emphasised by Le Mesurier as emblematic of the brutality of the ‘Assad regime,’ are inarguably indiscriminate and illegal under international law.
white Helmets provide essential services	2629	NoArgument	But if we are judging the merits or demerits of a given side in a given conflict based on the use of indiscriminate weapons alone then regime change in Washington, Tel Aviv and Riyadh is long overdue.
white Helmets provide essential services	2630	NoArgument	The brutality of the conflict in Syria is a reflection of the monumental stakes involved in the outcome.
white Helmets provide essential services	2631	NoArgument	The conflict is in itself is a crime, but are we seriously suggesting that Libya is better, safer and more stable seven years on from the toppling and murder of its leader Muammar Gaddafi, courtesy of NATO aligning with various Libyan opposition factions, prime among them Islamists, in 2011?
white Helmets provide essential services	2632	NoArgument	And are we seriously arguing that Syria’s fate would not be Libya’s fate in the event of the toppling of Bashar al-Assad?
white Helmets provide essential services	2633	NoArgument	And, too, is anybody able to maintain with a straight face that Bashar al-Assad does not enjoy the solid support of the majority of the Syrian people, who understand that the conflict is not about saving their government but saving their country?
white Helmets provide essential services	2634	Argument_against	“the White Helmets function as an effective propaganda arm of the anti-Assad movement.
white Helmets provide essential services	2635	Argument_against	With their training, equipment and logistical sustainment underwritten exclusively by donations from Western governments (primarily the U.S. and U.K.), the White Helmets serve as a virtual echo chamber for American and British politicians and officials.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2636	Argument_against	Given Le Mesurier’s background, along with the evidence of how the White Helmets operate, it is reasonable to assume that what we have is the cultivation of the very Third Force Washington and London have been extending themselves in trying to locate and sell as the ‘good guys’ since the conflict began, doing so with the objective of enlisting domestic public support for intervention and regime change in Damascus.
white Helmets provide essential services	2637	NoArgument	Of course, there is always the possibility that Mr Le Mesurier is sincere in his desire to alleviate the undoubted suffering of the Syrian people – though in his case clearly not all the Syrian people, what with White Helmets only functioning and operating in opposition controlled territory, places where neither he nor any Western supporter of the White Helmets would dare set foot, knowing the moment they did they would be abducted, tortured, and brutally murdered.
white Helmets provide essential services	2638	NoArgument	But if so, if Mr Le Mesurier is sincere, then he is Britain’s answer to Pyle, the idealistic and naïve American interventionist in French-occupied Vietnam created by Graham Greene in his classic novel The Quiet American .
white Helmets provide essential services	2639	NoArgument	“He was young and ignorant and silly and he got involved.
white Helmets provide essential services	2640	NoArgument	He had no more of a notion than any of you what the whole affair's about, and you gave him money and York Harding's books on the East and said, 'Go ahead.
white Helmets provide essential services	2641	NoArgument	Win the East for democracy.

white Helmets provide essential services	2645	NoArgument	What is your reaction to this so-called chemical attack in Syria?
white Helmets provide essential services	2646	NoArgument	How do you think this chemical attack occurs when the US says Assad's departure is no longer a priority?
white Helmets provide essential services	2647	NoArgument	Robert D. Steele: The attack was a false flag attack intended to deceive President Donald Trump and his closest advisors.
white Helmets provide essential services	2648	NoArgument	You gave me information about the involvement of the General McMaster, the former CIA chief John Brennan and the Senator John McCain.
white Helmets provide essential services	2649	NoArgument	What was their role in this chemical attack in Syria?
white Helmets provide essential services	2650	NoArgument	Do you think that these individuals must be brought before a court for high treason?
white Helmets provide essential services	2651	NoArgument	Was the current CIA director Mike Pompeo aware of this chemical attack?
white Helmets provide essential services	2652	NoArgument	There are conflicting stories about the actual chemical attack -- the Russians and Syrians are saying that a rebel stock was hit and that unleashed a cloud of chemicals.
white Helmets provide essential services	2653	Argument_against	In the US our inside source are saying the White Helmets were paid to create a false flag chemical attack.
white Helmets provide essential services	2654	NoArgument	I absolutely believe that Senator McCain should be impeached; John Brennan should be indicted, and General McMaster should be court-martialed.
white Helmets provide essential services	2655	NoArgument	About the US strike, how did it come about 24 hours after Hillary Clinton said she wanted an intervention in Syria?
white Helmets provide essential services	2656	NoArgument	What is your analysis of this strike?
white Helmets provide essential services	2657	NoArgument	The Russian battle damage assessment video is online and documents 23 out of 59 missiles hitting the air base.
white Helmets provide essential services	2658	NoArgument	That is a 39% combat effectiveness ratio, so I think the US Government should pay Raytheon 39% of list price in the future.
white Helmets provide essential services	2659	NoArgument	The strike may have been high theater -- certainly the Russians and Syrians were told in advance, and they also turned off their anti-missile defense systems.
white Helmets provide essential services	2660	NoArgument	The strike was unconstitutional and a mistake by our president based on bad information.
white Helmets provide essential services	2661	NoArgument	Some of our sources have told us that Daesh, after the blows it has suffered in Syria and Iraq, will redeploy in Africa and Europe.
white Helmets provide essential services	2662	NoArgument	Do you have any information on that?
white Helmets provide essential services	2663	NoArgument	I have no information on this but I believe that Angela Merkel among others wants Europe threatened by refugees and if she cannot attract enough terrorists with war on the Middle East she and the remnants of the Gestapo that still work for her will create more false flag attacks across Europe.
white Helmets provide essential services	2664	NoArgument	In your opinion, isn't President Donald Trump hostage of the Deep State, the neocons and the military-industrial complex?
white Helmets provide essential services	2665	NoArgument	Yes in general terms, because he is not challenging them where they are weakest.
white Helmets provide essential services	2666	NoArgument	Our president is gifted at mobilizing the public, he has failed to heed the advice of Cynthia McKinney and myself, among others, to sponsor the Electoral Reform Act and mobilize the larger public against the Deep State.
white Helmets provide essential services	2667	NoArgument	He has to beat the Deep State, but only if he creates a diversified base.
white Helmets provide essential services	2668	NoArgument	He is also in the process of losing the Alt-Right, we are all furious about this attack which is a direct violation of his promise to put America First and not be further engaged in foreign conflicts.
white Helmets provide essential services	2669	NoArgument	Why did President Trump choose when he received Chinese President Xi Jinping to order the strike?

white Helmets provide essential services	2759	Argument_against	White Helmets Constitute a Real and Potent Threat to British National Security and Safety of British Public - 21st Century Wire.
white Helmets provide essential services	2760	NoArgument	Philip Hammond, former UK Foreign Secretary with James Le Mesurier, ex MI5 founder of White Helmets, Raed Saleh, leader of White Helmets – in Gaziantep, Turkey.
white Helmets provide essential services	2761	Argument_against	Unequivocally, the settlement of some members of the ‘White Helmets’ constitutes a real and potent threat to British national security and to the safety of the British public, according to the British political analyst Dr. Marcus Papadopoulos, who asserts that the’White Helmets’ have not only been complicit in crimes against humanity but they have actually instigated such crimes in Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2762	NoArgument	In an interview with the Syriatimes e-newspaper about the settlement of the ‘White Helmets’ in several western countries and the consequences for the countries which have supported the terrorists in Syria as well as why his passion for Syria came about, the founder and editor of the ‘politics First’ magazine said:.
white Helmets provide essential services	2763	Argument_against	” The members of the White Helmets are not only religious extremists – Wahhabists – but, even worse, they are some of the most violent and depraved people you will ever come across in this life.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2764	Argument_against	“let me tell you this: many of the crimes perpetrated against humanity are some of the worst imaginable – heinous does not come anywhere close to describing what the White Helmets have done to Syrian civilians and Syrian prisoners of war.
white Helmets provide essential services	2765	Argument_against	The details of their crimes – which I have learnt about from friends and contacts in Syria – are too disturbing to talk about here but it is suffice to say that the White Helmets have demonstrated that human beings can be capable of carrying out acts which defy comprehension.
white Helmets provide essential services	2766	Argument_against	So, with that in mind, the fact that some members of the White Helmets are now in the UK constitutes a real and potent threat to British national security and to the safety of the British public.
white Helmets provide essential services	2767	Argument_against	Not only will White Helmets be able to freely walk the streets of British towns and cities spreading religious extremism but they have the capacity for violence, or, more specifically, terrorism.,” he added.
white Helmets provide essential services	2768	Argument_against	Dr. Papadopoulos affirmed that he would not be surprised in the least if there is a thwarted terrorist attack or an actual terrorist attack, in the future, in Britain, involving a member, or more than member, of the White Helmets.
white Helmets provide essential services	2769	NoArgument	” In such a scenario, how would the British authorities respond?
white Helmets provide essential services	2770	NoArgument	By saying something along the lines of:.
white Helmets provide essential services	2771	NoArgument	‘The involvement of a member of the White Helmets in this monstrous act was an isolated case and does not represent the overwhelming majority of the White Helmets, who have risked their own lives in the face against terror.’ Alas, the lives of ordinary Britons are being gambled with by their own authorities.
white Helmets provide essential services	2772	NoArgument	Despicable, to say the least,” he said.
white Helmets provide essential services	2773	NoArgument	No place, at all, for Wahhabism and its adherents in a post-war Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2774	NoArgument	Asked about his opinion regarding the fate of the approximate 14.000 ISIS and al-Nusra Front who exist now in Idlib – north of Syria, Dr. Papadopoulos underlined that those terrorists cannot be rehabilitated – after all, serial killers are beyond help and, more importantly, do not deserve help or sympathy.
white Helmets provide essential services	2775	NoArgument	And putting them in prison is risky because, whilst there, they will try and spread their vile extremist ideology – Wahhabism – to other prisoners thus infecting more minds.
white Helmets provide essential services	2776	NoArgument	“Now that Daraa and Quneitra have been liberated by the Syrian army and air force, Damascus’ attention is on Idlib.
white Helmets provide essential services	2777	NoArgument	Whilst there are behind-the-scenes talks between Russia and Turkey to try and resolve the future of Idlib peacefully, I believe that liberating this region by force, or, at least, parts of it by force, is unavoidable.
white Helmets provide essential services	2778	NoArgument	And it is absolutely vital to the security of Syria in a post-war world that the 14,000 ISIS and Al-Nusra terrorists are not allowed to remain in the country.
white Helmets provide essential services	2779	NoArgument	The Syrian military must either force them to retreat into Turkey, where they would feel very much at home, or neutralise them on the battlefield,” he said, asserting that there can be no place, at all, for Wahhabism and its adherents in a post-war Syria because, otherwise, they will simply keep their heads down until they have another opportunity to wreak carnage .
white Helmets provide essential services	2780	NoArgument	From Syrian Arab Army (unofficial) Facebook page.
white Helmets provide essential services	2781	NoArgument	Moreover, the British analyst made it clear that the ISIS and Al-Nusra terrorists who will retreat into Turkey will, undoubtedly, be allowed to live and work in the country and will probably be called upon, one day, by the Turkish authorities and its backers in Washington and London to go and fight a new war on the territory of another country.
white Helmets provide essential services	2782	NoArgument	“Let me remind you that since Afghanistan in the 1980s, Islamist militants have been one of the West’s most potent weapons at its disposal in its pursuit of geo-strategic objectives – from Bosnia to Chechnya to Kosovo to Libya to Syria,” Dr. Papadopoulos said.
white Helmets provide essential services	2783	NoArgument	SDF – Syrian ‘Democratic’ Forces.
white Helmets provide essential services	2784	NoArgument	He, in addition, commented on the forthcoming military campaign to liberate Idlib by saying: ” The campaign to liberate Idlib will be the final one of the war because after Idlib there will be no territory in Syria controlled by terrorists.
white Helmets provide essential services	2785	NoArgument	What we will see once the north-west of Syria is freed, are negotiations between the Syrian Government and the Syrian Kurds regarding the area currently controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, which, let us not forget, have been receiving aid from Damascus throughout most of the conflict; indeed, the Kurds took control of much of the north-east of Syria with the consent of Damascus so that Syrian army formations stationed there would be free to fight the terrorists in other parts of the country.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2786	NoArgument	the British analyst fully endorses the ongoing talks in Damascus between the Syrian Government and the SDF.
white Helmets provide essential services	2787	NoArgument	“I fully endorse the ongoing talks in Damascus between the Syrian Government and the SDF because they are allies and have much to gain by coming to an agreement with each other, and, conversely, have much to lose if they fail to come to an agreement, which I do not believe will actually happen.
white Helmets provide essential services	2788	NoArgument	I only wish that Damascus and the Syrian Kurds had been more united in the summer of 2012, as I said at the time they should be, because this failure resulted in the terrorists securing control of the Syrian-Turkish border and this is when Syria found itself in a perilous situation.
white Helmets provide essential services	2789	NoArgument	But that is water under the bridge, so to speak.
white Helmets provide essential services	2790	NoArgument	What matters now is for the Kurds to have some form of autonomy, while the border with Turkey is to come under, once again, the jurisdiction of Damascus, with the Syrian flag flying there and with the border patrolled by the Syrian army.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2791	NoArgument	Unintended consequences.
white Helmets provide essential services	2792	NoArgument	As for what have been achieved by the countries which have supported the terrorists in Syria, Dr.Papadopoulos said: ” those countries have achieved the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Syrians, and they have also weakened Syria overall but only in the short-term, in my opinion.
white Helmets provide essential services	2793	NoArgument	The Syria that will arise from this ghastly war will be more united and resilient than ever before and will be stronger than ever before.
white Helmets provide essential services	2794	NoArgument	And with Russia now having a very powerful military presence in Syria, this will only enhance Syrian security in the long-term.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2795	NoArgument	He also numbered several unintended consequences for the countries which have supported the terrorists in Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2796	NoArgument	“There are also unintended consequences for the countries which have supported the terrorists in Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2797	NoArgument	Firstly, their actions resulted in Russia returning to the Middle East in a very resurgent way, from which Moscow now has an appeal to people across the region; secondly, an unofficial alliance of Russia, Syria and Iran has emerged, which will counter the unofficial alliance of America, Israel and Saudi Arabia; and thirdly, the terrorist threat in America and especially in Britain has become all the more severe.
white Helmets provide essential services	2798	NoArgument	Regarding the last unintended consequence, there is the old and very true saying: “If you play with fire, you get burned.” However, it is ordinary, innocent Britons and Americans who are now exposed to that fire.”.
white Helmets provide essential services	2799	NoArgument	He went on to say: “Today, the conflict in Syria is finally coming to an end, meaning that peace will return to the lives of the Syrian people, although there will be the challenge of rebuilding the infrastructure of the country and achieving reconciliation in the parts which witnessed the bulk of the fighting.
white Helmets provide essential services	2800	NoArgument	But given that the Syrian people have overcome what can only be described as pure evil, I have no doubt, whatsoever, that they will successfully rebuild their country and surpass the level of security and stability that they enjoyed prior to 2011,” he said.
white Helmets provide essential services	2801	NoArgument	Syrian people would prevail against the Western-backed Wahhabist hordes.
white Helmets provide essential services	2802	NoArgument	Dr. Papadopoulos’ interest in Syria, which would eventually lead him to a passion for the country, emerged in August 1991, when he was on holiday with my family in Cyprus.
white Helmets provide essential services	2803	NoArgument	He was 12 years old at the time and was having dinner one night in The Old Limassol Restaurant, in the port city of Limassol.
white Helmets provide essential services	2804	NoArgument	His Father was telling him that Syria was ready to go to war with Turkey as a result of Turkish threats to restrict the flow of water running into Syria from the Euphrates.
white Helmets provide essential services	2805	NoArgument	He told him that Syria had long supported Cyprus against Turkey and that the Syrians had a very close relationship with Russia, or the Soviet Union, as it was then.
white Helmets provide essential services	2806	NoArgument	His Father added to the point about the Syrian-Russian friendship by saying to him that: “You should learn about Syria because the country is a good friend to Russia” (His love for Russia was very well established by then and his Father knew this).
white Helmets provide essential services	2807	NoArgument	So, on returning to the UK from my holiday in Cyprus, He began reading about the history, politics, culture and geography of Syria, at his local library, though his initial focus was on the relationship between Damascus and Moscow.
white Helmets provide essential services	2808	NoArgument	The more he read, and the older he became, the more intrigued and fascinated he became with Syria and the Syrian people.
white Helmets provide essential services	2809	NoArgument	He discovered that Damascus is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, going back 11,000 years; he learned of the ancient Christian town of Maaloula where the people there speak the language of Jesus Christ, Aramaic; He read about the remarkable Umayyad Mosque in Damascus; he saw photographs of ancient Greek and Roman sites in Syria, such as Apamea and Palmyra; he was spellbound by the beauty of the Syrian coastline; he was enthused by how Syria had one of the lowest crime rates of any country in the world; he was fascinated by the ancient and mysterious ethnic and religious groups in the country, such as the Druze and the Assyrians; he was delighted at the close relationship between Syria and Yugoslavia, under Hafez Al-Assad and Josip Broz Tito, respectively; and he was captivated by how mosques and churches stood side by side in Syria, with imams and priests holding prayers in each other’s temples (Syria is one of the most successful examples of multiculturalism anywhere in the world).
white Helmets provide essential services	2810	NoArgument	Soon after he completed his PhD, in late 2006, he became a reporter and writer for Tribune (a socialist publication in the UK founded by Sir Stafford Cripps and George Strauss and which George Orwell was once the literary editor of) and would, from time to time, write articles relating to Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2811	NoArgument	In one such article, published in 2007, he wrote that Russia, as part of its campaign to reassert itself in the international arena, would look to strengthen its military presence in Syria.
white Helmets provide essential services	2812	NoArgument	By the time that the sickening war on Syria commenced, in 2011, his passion for the country was intense and he was only too eager to start giving television interviews and writing articles, in the fall of 2011, on the war which was being waged on the Syrian people by Wahhabist terrorists supported by the West, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
white Helmets provide essential services	2813	NoArgument	The brutal and merciless campaign against Syria has left an impact on him; the staggering loss in Syrian life and the destruction wrought on one of the most ancient, special and beautiful of countries in the world, defies belief.
white Helmets provide essential services	2814	NoArgument	And the nature of the terrorists who have been sent into Syria to wage war against the Syria people gives a whole new meaning to the word depraved.
white Helmets provide essential services	2815	NoArgument	“Despite the grim situation which Syria found itself in, from 2012 to 2015, Inever lost my belief that the Syrian people would prevail against the Western-backed Wahhabist hordes, and his conviction that Russia’s support to the Syrian people would continue, unabated, never faltered, ” Dr. Papadopoulos concluded.
